"""tools/test_livestream_demo.py — standalone WebSocket demo/test driver for
webSMLM's live streaming feature (window.webSMLM.liveStream), with NO browser
automation at all: this runs a tiny local WebSocket SERVER that YOUR OWN,
already-open webSMLM.html tab (any browser — Firefox included) connects OUT
to, opt-in, only when you click "Connect" in its "Live streaming" sidebar
section -- which also arms streaming, no separate step needed. Nothing here
launches, controls, or even needs to know about a browser process.

Setup (once):
    pip install numpy tifffile websockets

Usage:
    python tools/test_livestream_demo.py
    # Open webSMLM.html yourself, in whatever browser tab you already have.
    # In the sidebar: open "Live streaming" (collapsed by default), set the
    # WebSocket URL to ws://localhost:8765 (this script's default), and click
    # "Connect" -- that alone arms streaming, no separate step. Come back
    # here and press Enter to start sending simulated frame chunks; watch the
    # SMLM reconstruction panel fill in live.

Wire format: each chunk is sent as one WebSocket BINARY message (raw TIFF
bytes) — no extra framing needed, since WebSocket already frames messages
for us. A final `{"cmd":"stop"}` TEXT message finalizes the streaming
session on the page (the same session-ending call clicking "Stop" there
uses, but WITHOUT closing the connection or your tab — so this script can
still receive the final stopAck below). webSMLM talks back over the same
connection: `{"cmd":"ack","framesReceived":N,"chunkCount":C,"ok":bool}`
after every chunk it processes (ok=false if that chunk failed to decode/
localize — framesReceived then stays unchanged from the previous ack), and
`{"cmd":"stopAck","framesReceived":N,"chunkCount":C}` once it has handled
our stop message — the authoritative final count. This script compares
that against how many frames it actually sent and prints a warning if any
went missing.

This is a different bridge from tools/webSMLM-livestream-bridge.mjs, which launches
and owns its own Playwright-driven Chromium window instead — the right
choice for a fully automated/headless session (e.g. a real Gladoscopy RT
node), but the wrong one when you just want to hook into a tab you already
have open.
