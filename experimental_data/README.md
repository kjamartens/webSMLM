# Experimental data

Links to publicaly available SMLM stacks for benchmarking and validation. Locally added files are currently git-ignored — see [`.gitignore`](.gitignore).
That is deliberate:

- **This repository is public.** Committing a stack publishes it, along with any
  licensing or prior-publication implications.
- **GitHub rejects files over 100 MB** and warns above 50 MB. Raw SMLM stacks are
  routinely far larger.
- **Git history is permanent.** A large binary committed once bloats every future
  clone even if it is deleted in a later commit.

The files are still fully usable locally — they are simply untracked.


## Dataset I — DNA nanorulers

GATTAquant GATTA-PAINT 80R DNA-PAINT nanoruler (80 nm mark-to-mark), acquired
on a Leica GSD system.

**Full raw dataset (public):** [`GATTA-PAINT-80R-RAW.zip`](https://www.gattaquant.com/files/GATTA-PAINT-80R-RAW.zip)
from GATTAquant.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Native frame size | 180 × 180 px |
| Bit depth | 16-bit, uncompressed |
| Byte order | little-endian per individual frame; **big-endian once concatenated into a stack by ImageJ** |
| **Pixel size** | **99.2 nm** (from XResolution 4294967295/42605 = 100808.996 px/cm) |
| Exposure | 80 ms |

**The public download is not a single ready-to-load stack** — it's one TIFF
per frame. webSMLM loads it directly: click **Load movie**, then select all
the frame files at once (Ctrl/Cmd+click, or your file manager's "select all")

Three reasons this dataset is a good fixture beyond raw speed:

- **It exercises the multi-file loader** (`loadTiffSequence`) — natural
  filename sorting (so frame 2 sorts before frame 10) and per-file decoding,
  each frame in its own little-endian byte order.
- **It carries a resolution ground truth** — the 80 nm mark-to-mark spacing
  lets the FRC precision work be validated against a known distance rather
  than only self-consistency.

**FRC on this dataset shows extra peaks at 40 nm and 20 nm**, alongside the
expected 80 nm one — exact submultiples of the ruler spacing (80/2, 80/4).
A periodic structure like a regularly-spaced nanoruler array
concentrates its Fourier content at the fundamental spatial frequency *and*
its harmonics, so FRC — which assumes a generic, non-periodic structure —
picks those harmonics. Expect this on any sufficiently periodic sample.

## Dataset II — 3D STORM (very large, ~4.9 GB)

3D STORM of spectrin rings in neurons, by **Christophe Leterrier**, on figshare:
[3D STORM spectrin rings in neurons](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/3D_STORM_spectrin_rings_in_neurons/19165061).

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Frames | ~40,000 |
| Frame size | 256 × 256 px |
| Format | large multi-IFD TIFF (Micro-Manager MMStack) — indexed by walking the IFD chain |
| On disk | ~4.9 GB (**never loaded whole — streamed frame-by-frame via `File.slice()`**) |

A good stress test for large-stack handling: webSMLM never loads the file
whole — frames are streamed on demand via `File.slice()` — so this is a
practical check that a multi-GB stack processes without the browser running
out of memory. It's also a real 3D dataset, useful for exercising Phasor 3D
and z-drift correction on something larger than the synthetic generator.

**Camera parameters** (Andor iXon 897 EMCCD, 16 µm physical pixel, 256×256
center quadrant, 160 nm/pixel post-magnification; acquisition settings
confirmed by Christophe Leterrier from the Nikon NIS-Elements panel): **EM
gain = 100**, **e⁻/ADU = 0.1248**, baseline 100 ADU.

**webSMLM settings to match:** Pixel size (nm) = **160**; Camera offset (ADU)
= **100**; Camera gain (photons/ADU) = **0.1248** — used directly, *not*
divided by the EM gain again, since NIS-Elements' "e⁻/ADU" readout already
reflects the current EM gain setting (system gain at a given EM setting =
unity-gain sensitivity ÷ EM gain). Also consistent physically: 0.1248 e⁻/ADU
alone would cap the 16-bit ADC at ~8,000 e⁻, far below this sensor's
~180,000 e⁻ well depth, while ×100 = 12.48 e⁻/ADU is a plausible unity-gain
figure. The iXon 897 has a known QE curve (~92.5% peak at 575 nm,
back-illuminated) that isn't part of the reported settings above, so as with
the EPFL dataset's stated 0.90 e⁻/photon, a QE correction could be layered
on top if wanted — not applied here.

## Dataset III — 3D astigmatism ground truth (EPFL SMLM 2016 Challenge)

Three files from the EPFL Biomedical Imaging Group's SMLM 2016 3D simulation
challenge, astigmatism (AS) modality, `MT0.N1` microtubule structure —
[bigwww.epfl.ch/srm/dataset/challenge-3D-simulation](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/srm/dataset/challenge-3D-simulation/index.html)
(Sage et al., *Super-resolution fight club*, Nat. Methods 2019). Unlike the
other stacks in this folder, these are **fully synthetic with known
ground-truth emitter positions** (`positions.csv` / `activations.csv`,
published alongside the LD/HD downloads on the site but not included here) —
the right fixture for validating fit *accuracy* against a known answer, not
just self-consistency.

| File | Role | Frames | Frame size | On disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sequence-as-stack-Beads-AS-Exp.tif` | Z-calibration bead stack | 151 | 150 × 150 px | 6.5 MB |
| `sequence-as-stack-MT0.N1.HD-AS-Exp.tif` | High-density microtubules (ground truth) | 2'500 | 64 × 64 px | 19.9 MB |
| `sequence-as-stack-MT0.N1.LD-AS-Exp.tif` | Low-density microtubules (ground truth) | 19'996 | 64 × 64 px | 158.9 MB |

Frame counts and dimensions above were verified directly from each file's own
embedded ImageJ `images=` tag and TIFF `ImageWidth`/`ImageLength` (16-bit,
big-endian), not just copied off the site — its shared "Parameters of
simulation" table lists a generic 64 px / 6400 nm field of view that does
**not** apply to the beads file, which is actually 150 × 150 px (that row is
evidently boilerplate inherited from the MT0.N1 page template).

**Simulation / camera parameters** (from the HD dataset's and beads z-stack's
"Parameters of simulation" tables on the site; MT0.N1 LD and HD share the same
"N1" noise profile — *"typical photon counts and background levels for
Alexa647 labelled STORM sample"*):

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Pixel size | 100.00 nm (MT0.N1 HD/LD; not embedded as a TIFF resolution tag — set manually) |
| Quantum efficiency (QE) | 0.90 e⁻/photon |
| Wavelength | 660.00 nm |
| Numerical aperture (NA) | 1.49 |
| Read-out noise | Gaussian, σ = 74.4 e⁻ |
| EM gain | 300× (Gamma-distributed multiplicative noise) |
| Spurious (clock-induced) charge | Poisson, mean 0.0020 e⁻/pixel/frame |
| Electron conversion | 45.00 e⁻/ADU |
| Baseline (offset) | 100.00 ADU |
| Saturation | 65535 ADU (16-bit) |
| **Total system gain** (QE × EM gain / e⁻ per ADU) | **6.00 ADU/photon** |

**webSMLM settings to match:** Pixel size (nm) = **100**; Camera offset (ADU)
= **100**; Camera gain (photons/ADU) = **1 / 6.00 ≈ 0.167** (webSMLM's field
multiplies ADU by this to get photons — the site's "total gain" is the
inverse, ADU *per* photon).

**Beads z-calibration:** 6 beads/slice, z-step 10 nm, range −750 to +750 nm,
focal plane (z = 0) at the centre slice → **frame 76 of 151**, a ready value
for the "z=0 ref frame" field. Spanning the full ±750 nm defocus range end to
end, it's also a good stress-test for the "Fix bead x,y" calibration option
(v0.9.x) — large defocus is exactly where per-frame detection is prone to
drift or split.

**Molecule density:** LD "0.2", HD "2" (unit not stated on the source page).

**Candidates for committing as fixtures:** `sequence-as-stack-Beads-AS-Exp.tif`
(6.5 MB) and `sequence-as-stack-MT0.N1.HD-AS-Exp.tif` (19.9 MB) are both well
under GitHub's 50 MB warning threshold — worth force-adding once we've
validated webSMLM's fits against the published ground truth, so future
regression checks don't depend on re-downloading from EPFL.
`sequence-as-stack-MT0.N1.LD-AS-Exp.tif` (158.9 MB) stays local-only regardless
(over the 100 MB hard limit).

## Dataset IV — spectrally resolved SMLM pair-finding

Data for Figure 2A of Martens et al. "
*Enabling Spectrally Resolved Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy at
High Emitter Densities*", *Nano Lett.* **22**(21), 8618–8625 (2022),
[10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03140](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03140).
The full dataset behind the paper — TIFF stacks for Figures 2–4 and
Supplementary Figures 1–2, plus processed CSVs, 19.3 GB total — is on Zenodo:
[10.5281/zenodo.6778964](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6778964).

Localize run across **4
combined, cropped movies loaded together** via the multi-file "combine
several multi-frame TIFFs" path (`loadTiffFilesAuto()`/`makeConcatStack()`,
see **in/out** in `CLAUDE.md`), then **Pair**. 100,000 frames total, z holds
the inter-order distance (~2,994–3,110 nm here), same trick as always.

Data found a sharp **distance peak** against the expected smooth
combinatorial background, and a **dominant angle at ~0°/180°** within that
window. The module's own `PARAMS` defaults
(`sSmlmDistMin=2200, sSmlmDistMax=2800, sSmlmAngleTol=5`) were tuned to that
peak, recovering 547,183 pairs (64.0%) there, mean distance 2546 ± 73 nm — a
mean-position sanity check (averaging all 0th-order positions vs. all
matched 1st-order positions, an entirely independent computation from the
per-pair distance stat) reproduced a (2544, 87) nm separation, confirming
the pairs found were self-consistent.

## Dataset V — dual-view (image-splitter) ALEX TIRF smFRET

`alex50mW_1_MMStack_Default.ome.tif` (264 MB, 500 frames, 512×512 px,
Micro-Manager OME-TIFF). Acquired on an Andor iXon DU897_BV EMCCD (EM
gain 300, 30 ms exposure, ~32.02 ms actual per-frame interval — see below),
via pycromanager/Micro-Manager 2.0. Genuinely different optical layout from
Dataset IV above: this is a **dual-view/image-splitter** TIRF setup —
donor emission on the LEFT half of the sensor, acceptor emission on the
RIGHT half — not a diffraction-grating setup, so a real donor/acceptor pair
sits **tens of micrometers apart** on the same frame, not the few-hundred-nm
separation Dataset IV's grating dispersion produces. This is what motivated
removing `sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmDistMax`'s fixed 20000 nm ceiling (see
`CLAUDE.md`'s **sSMLM** module notes) — those two fields now have no upper
limit, only the practical bound of the localization bounding box's own
diagonal.

**No pixel size is embedded anywhere in this file** — checked directly (both
`tifffile` and webSMLM's own `tiffScaleHint()`): the OME-XML `<Pixels>`
element has no `PhysicalSizeX`/`PhysicalSizeY` attributes at all, and the
per-frame Micro-Manager metadata explicitly reports `PixelSizeUm: 0.0` (never
calibrated in software). The TIFF's own XResolution tag (`t282`) is present
but is `4294967295/1` — the classic 0xFFFFFFFF "unset" RATIONAL sentinel, not
a real value — which is what led to fixing `tiffScaleHint()` to sanity-check
the resolved pixel size instead of trusting any tag with a nonzero value (a
real, previously-latent bug: the naive check logged a fabricated-looking
"pixel size ≈ 0.0 nm/px" for this exact file). **Pixel size (nm) must be set
by hand** for this dataset — there's no metadata anywhere in the file to
derive it from.

**Frame time IS derivable — via a new, separate mechanism, `mmMetadataHint()`**
(see `CLAUDE.md`'s in/out module notes): there's no `finterval=` key in
either description text, but the per-frame Micro-Manager metadata
(`MicroManagerMetadata`, TIFF tag 51123 — a genuine JSON blob per frame,
which `tiffScaleHint()` never reads) carries a real `ElapsedTime-ms`
timestamp on every frame. Loading this file now logs a second metadata
line alongside the existing one: `camera iXon | DU897_BV | 5673, exposure
30 ms (set point — real inter-frame time may differ, see below), frame
interval ≈ 32.01 ms (median of 24 sampled inter-frame gaps)` — matching the
`Camera-ActualInterval-ms: "32.02"` this file's own metadata separately
confirms, and clearly NOT the 30 ms exposure setting.

## Useful properties to note for benchmarking

When adding a stack, record these — they determine which speed optimizations
matter and make timings comparable:

| Property | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Frame size (px) | Band-pass cost scales with pixel count |
| Frame count | Determines whether streaming or in-RAM loading is used |
| Bit depth / endianness | Exercises the TIFF decode paths |
| Pixel size (nm) | Needed for correct nm-space output |
| Approx. σ_PSF (px) | Sets the DoG kernel size — the dominant cost term |
| Emitter density | Affects detection count and the fit-vs-detect time split |
