# webSMLM — Documentation

A detailed reference for every button, control, parameter and module —
complementary to the in-app **Quick guide**, which stays deliberately sparse
(a quick walkthrough, not a manual). This file is the place for the detail
that doesn't belong in a UI popover: exact defaults, min/max/step, what each
control actually does under the hood, and the on-disk file formats.

**Scope note:** this describes behaviour, not implementation — it should stay
accurate without needing a rewrite on every internal refactor. When editing
`webSMLM.html`, prefer expanding this file over adding a long inline comment;
a comment should only explain a non-obvious *why*, not *what* (see
`CLAUDE.md`). If a described default/range drifts out of sync with the
`PARAMS` registry, `PARAMS` is authoritative — this file describes it, not
the other way round.

**This file is also the source for the app's own in-app "more info…"
popups** (the `.hint` divs next to each sidebar control group — a third,
separate layer from both this manual and the sparse Quick guide modal).
Each popup's content lives inside a `<!-- HINT:<name> --> ... <!-- /HINT:<name>
-->` marker below, kept in sync with `webSMLM.html` by `tools/sync_hints.mjs`
— edit the marker, then run the script; never hand-edit a `.hint` div
directly (see `CLAUDE.md`'s **Documentation build** section for the full
mechanism).

References below point at `webSMLM.html`'s own `id=`/function names, which
stay stable across versions — exact line numbers aren't given, since they
drift as the file grows.

## 1 · Exploring the user interface

### Header

Two small buttons live top-left of the whole page, outside the header
itself: `sideToggle` (⇤, collapse/re-open the sidebar — floats as an
overlay on re-open so toggling never resizes the canvases) and `sidePin`
(📌, dock a floating sidebar back into the normal layout).

The header (top-right, next to the title) holds two controls, neither a
`PARAMS` entry nor part of Save/Load Settings — both are pure display/
layout, not analysis parameters:

- A **colour theme** switch — three small icon buttons
  (`themeLightBtn`/`themeDarkBtn`/`themeContrastBtn`, ☀/☾/◐), one click
  each to switch between dark (the app's original look), light, and a
  high-contrast theme. Persisted via `localStorage` (`webSMLM_theme`),
  wrapped in `try`/`catch` — a blocked/unavailable store falls back to
  dark (this app's only theme before this existed) on read, and silently
  keeps working for the rest of the session (just not remembered next
  visit) on write; no error ever surfaces either way.
- `layoutToggleBtn` ("Stack panels"/"Side by side"), which switches the
  two main data panels between side-by-side and stacked (full-width, one
  above the other), overriding the automatic choice `initScrub()` makes
  from the loaded stack's own aspect ratio. Hidden below the ~860px mobile
  breakpoint, where the panels are already forced to one column
  unconditionally — the toggle would have nothing left to switch there.

A second, unrelated `localStorage` key (`webSMLM_lastVersion`) tracks which
release this browser last saw, independent of theme — see **Log window**
below for what it does.

### Sidebar — action buttons

| Button | id | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Load movie/data** | `loadBtn` | Opens a file picker accepting EITHER a movie (one multi-frame TIFF, or Ctrl/Cmd+click several files to combine them into one stack, natural-sorted by filename — either several single-frame TIFFs, one file = one frame, e.g. a per-frame camera dump, OR several multi-frame TIFFs from ONE continuous acquisition split purely by size, each file = a chunk of frames; which one is auto-detected from the first file's own frame count) OR a single CSV previously written by **Save data**, detected by file extension. Selecting a CSV and a movie together is refused with a logged error — pick one type at a time. See **in/out**/**pipeline** below. |
| **Simulate movie** | `genBtn` | Generates a synthetic stack from the *Simulation settings* module — no file needed, useful for a quick smoke-test or teaching demo. |
| **Load settings** | `loadSetBtn` | Opens a `.json` file (as saved by **Save settings**) and applies every recognised `{id: value}` pair to the `PARAMS` registry — unknown/legacy keys are logged and ignored, not errored on. |
| **Save settings** | `saveSetBtn` | Dumps the *current* value of every `PARAMS` entry (not just ones with a page control) to a `webSMLM_settings.json` file — see [§4](#4-settings-json-format). |
| **Localize** | `runBtn` | Runs detection + fitting over the whole loaded/simulated stack — the main action. Disabled until a stack is loaded. |
| **Stop** | `stopBtn` | Requests an early stop of a running **Localize** or **3D calibration**. Localize keeps whatever localizations were gathered so far (a partial result is still valid). Calibration discards everything instead — a calibration fit needs the WHOLE configured z-range, so a partial one would be silently biased, not just smaller; press **3D calibration** again to restart with a narrower/correct frame range. |
| **Save data** | `saveBtn` | Exports the current (filtered) localizations as a ThunderSTORM-compatible CSV — see [§6](#6-csv-export-format). Disabled until there are localizations. |
| **Save plot/image** | `saveImgBtn` | Opens a chooser (if both panels have content) to export the raw/reconstruction/plot window shown. The raw frame or reconstruction always saves as a supersampled PNG. A plot (calibration/drift/NeNA/FRC/PCFO/line-profile/histogram) instead opens a save dialog offering **both** PNG and SVG as file types — pick the format in the dialog's own "Save as type" dropdown. (Browsers without a native save-file dialog, e.g. Safari/Firefox, fall back to a PNG download — SVG needs the native dialog to choose.) |
| **View data/filtering** | `tableBtn` | Opens the sortable, filterable localizations table — see [§5](#5-table--filter-grammar). Disabled until there are localizations; during **Live streaming** this enables as soon as any localization has arrived, same as **Correct drift**/NeNA/FRC — see [§2](#table)'s "Available during Live streaming" note for what's restricted (committing a new filter) vs. not (browsing/sorting/histograms). Loading a CSV back in (via **Load movie/data** above) works exactly as after a Run — table, reconstruction, NeNA/FRC/drift/re-export all function on it, using only what's in the CSV plus the *current* Pixel size / Magnification controls; there's no raw frame data, so `stack` is left untouched and re-detection/live preview stay unavailable for CSV-loaded data — see [§6](#6-csv-export-format). |
| **Quick guide** | `helpBtn` | Opens the in-app quick-reference modal (guided workflow, acknowledgements, licence). Shares its row with **View data/filtering**. |

**Keyboard hotkeys**: hold **Alt** (the same physical key macOS labels
Option/⌥) to show numbered hints over these 10 buttons, in on-screen order —
tap the matching digit to click one. Add **Shift** and the same 10 digits
instead toggle one of the 10 collapsible module sections below open/closed,
scrolling to and focusing its header so the next Tab press lands on that
section's first field. A hint only appears for a button that's currently
enabled or a section currently on screen; the digit each one maps to never
changes based on that, so it stays predictable across sessions. **Alt+T**
(either Shift state) jumps straight to the log terminal (below). A handful
of single, fixed **Alt+Shift** letter bindings — shown as their own hint
badges alongside the section digits — reach a few frequently-used fields
directly: **Alt+Shift+P** jumps to and selects **Pixel size (nm)**,
**Alt+Shift+F** to **Frame time (s)**, and **Alt+Shift+S** clicks the
**Stack panels**/**Side by side** toggle.

### Sidebar — Pixel size (nm) / Frame time (s) {#sidebar-pxnm-frametime}

`pxnm` and `frametime` sit as two plain, always-visible rows directly below
the action buttons/progress bar — deliberately NOT inside any collapsible
module. `pxnm` used to live inside **Localisation settings** (collapsed by
default) alongside Gain/Camera offset; pinned out here instead (v1/first
pass, expected to be refined further) since it's easy to forget it's there
while buried in a closed section, despite feeding the scale bar, z, and
every exported CSV coordinate — see [§3](#render-params) for the full
parameter entry. Gain/Camera offset stay inside **Localisation settings**
for now.

`frametime` (labelled **Frame time (s)**, renamed from `sptFrameTime` in
v0.12.1-dev) joined it for the same reason: a per-dataset acquisition
property exactly like pixel size, not something specific to
**Single-particle tracking** despite that module being its only current
consumer — used to live inside `sptBox` (also collapsed by default). See
[§3](#spt-params) for the full parameter entry and
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm) for the temporary `sptFrameTime`
back-compat alias (headless `config`, saved Settings JSON, and `?autorun=`
URLs with the old key all still work, with a deprecation warning logged,
until external scripts/settings have had time to migrate).

### Sidebar — collapsible modules

Each is a `<details>` element; opening one doesn't affect the others. All
carry their own **more info…** button, opening a popup with in-context help
(a shared `#infoModal`, same mechanism as the localizations table popup,
rather than expanding inline — inline hint text at the sidebar's own
font-size/contrast was hard to read for anything longer than a line or two)
— this section summarizes what's *in* each, not what the help text already
says.

- **Localisation settings** (`locBox`) — **Real-time update**, then
  Gain/Camera offset/**Get estimate** (moved to the top, right below it —
  the module's three most-consulted controls), then fit method, detection
  filter, FTM, frame range; one shared "more info…" popup covers all of it
  (`pxnm` itself moved out to its own always-visible sidebar row, see
  above). See [§3](#detect-params)/[§3](#fit-params)/[§3](#export-params).
- **Rendering settings** (`renderBox`) — magnification, colour map, and
  (3D/sSMLM-paired results only) depth/distance colouring. See
  [§3](#render-params)/[§2](#render).
- **Drift correction & precision** (`driftBox`) — **Correct drift**/**Show
  drift** (AIM or Cross correlation), plus **NeNA**/**FRC** underneath —
  one section, one shared "more info…" popup (two independent JS modules,
  `drift` and `locprecision`, that turned out to be workflow-sequential
  enough — correct drift, then measure how good the corrected result is —
  to combine in the sidebar). See
  [§3](#drift-params)/[§2](#drift)/[§2](#locprecision).
- **Simulation settings** (`simBox`) — only relevant when using **Simulate
  movie**. See [§3](#simulation-params)/[§2](#simulation).
- **Memory & streaming** (`memBox`) — `memBudgetGB`/`memgb`/`chunkmb`. See
  [§3](#in-out-params)/[§2](#in-out).
- **Gain & offset estimation** (`pcfoBox`) — **Estimate**/**Transfer
  estimates**. Placed here, before **3D calibration**, since both are
  one-off "derive a number from data, then use it below" steps run before
  the main Localize. See [§3](#pcfo-params)/[§2](#fit).
- **3D calibration** (`calibBox`) — **Calibrate**/**Save calib.**. See
  [§3](#3d-calibration-params)/[§7](#7-calibration-json-format)/[§2](#3d-calibration).
- **(Caution!) Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)** (`sSmlmBox`) — pairs 0th/1st-order
  localizations from a diffraction grating (or a prism-split donor/acceptor
  pair, for smFRET); enabled as soon as there are localizations (Run or
  **Load data**), not gated on a specific fit method. The sidebar label's
  "(Caution!)" prefix flags this as one specific, scope-limited method
  (directional pairing on a single configured bearing/tolerance), not a
  general-purpose technique — same prefix on **Time traces and FRET** and
  **Single-particle tracking** below, for the same reason. See
  [§3](#ssmlm-params)/[§2](#ssmlm).
- **(Caution!) Time traces and FRET** (`smfretBox`) — **Localize
  SOI**/**Pair DD + DA**/**Get (FRET) data**; enabled as soon as a movie is
  loaded, not gated on any Localize result. The **Analyse FRET** checkbox
  (default on, right below **Average # of frames**) is this module's own
  discoverability switch — unticking it disables **Pair DD + DA** while
  leaving everything else (plain intensity-vs-time traces, with
  **Alternating-laser excitation** on and no pairing, DD and AA both)
  fully usable — see [§2](#smfret) for the full explanation. Same
  "(Caution!)" reasoning as **Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)** above. See
  [§3](#smfret-params)/[§2](#smfret).
- **(Caution!) Single-particle tracking** (`sptBox`) — links localizations into
  trajectories and computes a per-track diffusion coefficient; enabled as
  soon as there are localizations, same gating as Pairing (sSMLM & FRET).
  See [§3](#spt-params)/[§2](#spt).

### Main data panels

`#canvases` (the grid wrapping both) gets a `.stacked` class — switching it
from side-by-side (`minmax(0,1fr) minmax(0,1fr)` columns) to a single column —
whenever the loaded stack's `h/w < 0.5` (the default suggestion, applied via
`applyLayout()` — called from `initScrub()` alongside the `--frame-ar`
custom property both canvases share); a very wide/short frame would
otherwise render tiny twice over (squeezed to half width on top of already
being short). The **Stack panels**/**Side by side** button
(`layoutToggleBtn` — see **Header** above) overrides this: once
clicked, `layoutOverride` (true/false) takes over from the `h/w<0.5`
heuristic and sticks across further loads this session, rather than every
new movie silently resetting the user's own choice — `applyLayout()` is the
single place that resolves override-vs-heuristic into the actual class. A
`ResizeObserver` on `#canvases` (not just a `window` `resize` listener,
which only fires for actual viewport changes) redraws both panels' backing
stores whenever their on-screen box size changes for *any* reason — this
toggle, the sidebar dock/float/collapse buttons, or an actual window resize.

A line plot or histogram drawn on either canvas (the raw/SR panel plot
pattern below) does NOT resize the panel itself — the canvas always keeps
tracking `--frame-ar` exactly like a real frame/reconstruction view, so a
panel's height never changes depending on whether it (or its sibling) is
currently showing a frame or a plot. Instead, `setupPlot(cv,true)` (every
plot-drawing function passes `true`; the frame/reconstruction drawers
don't) letterboxes a fixed 4/3 sub-rectangle centred within the panel's own
(unchanged) box — filling the whole canvas with the plot's own background
colour first so the letterbox bars are invisible, then translating so the
plot's own drawing code (unaware of any of this) draws into the sub-rect as
if it were the whole canvas. 4/3 matches matplotlib's own default figure
size. Each canvas's own controls (`#scrubRow`/`#srFilterNote`) are wrapped
with it in a `.panel-body` div, which is top-aligned (NOT
centered) — since raw/sr canvases are now always exactly the same height,
centering each panel's own canvas+controls group independently used to
shift the two canvases out of alignment with each other by roughly half of
whichever trailing control only one panel has (raw's `#scrubRow` has no sr
equivalent when `#srFilterNote` is hidden). Top-aligning
keeps both canvases flush against their own title row always, so they start
at the same y regardless of what trailing content either panel has.

Every plot function reads its colours from `plotColors()` rather than a
hardcoded hex value: dark on screen (`#161b22` background, matching the
app's own permanently-dark chrome — there's no separate light/dark app
theme to switch between), light (`#f6f8fa`, the original palette) only for
`exportPanel()`'s "plot" branch — which flips the shared `_plotExportMode`
flag, calls the panel's own `_replotRaw`/`_replotSr` to redraw once in
light colours, snapshots that, then flips back and redraws again so the
on-screen view is left exactly as it was. A saved PNG is meant for a
paper/report, where a white background reads better; the live view stays
dark to match the rest of the UI.
- **Raw frame** (`raw` canvas) — the loaded stack's current frame with
  detected ROIs (green) and accepted localizations (magenta crosshairs)
  overlaid; doubles as a **plot surface** for FRC/NeNA/drift/calibration
  curves and column histograms when there's nothing to show as a frame
  (`rawIsPlot`/`rawPlotName`). `measureBtn`/`cropBtn` (line-profile and crop
  tools) live in the *reconstruction* panel's header but draw their overlay
  on whichever panel is currently a live reconstruction. `rawFtmBtn`,
  inline in the panel title next to "Raw frame" (shown only while
  `ftmEnabled` is checked, its own label reading "Show FTM corrected" /
  "Show raw"), toggles the panel between the raw frame and its live
  FTM-corrected preview — the title itself stays fixed at "Raw frame" — see
  [§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)'s FTM section. Hovering shows a
  crosshair + readout of the pixel under the cursor — `x=`/`y=` (native pixel
  index, 0-based) and its value in ADU, plus the photon-converted equivalent
  once `gain`/`camoffset` are set away from the uncalibrated 1/0 default
  (`rawPixelData`, the array `drawRaw()` was actually given — raw camera data,
  or FTM-corrected when the raw/FTM toggle is on — kept separately from
  `rawFull`, which is only a lossy min/max-normalized 8-bit render). Reuses
  the same hover mechanism as the plot surfaces above (`registerPlotHover`/
  `drawPlotHover`); no readout while zoomed out past fit and hovering the
  letterboxed border outside the actual frame. `rawCropBtn`, inline in this
  panel's own title (enabled as soon as a stack is loaded, unlike `cropBtn`
  below), is a **second, unrelated crop tool** — click two corners to
  **replace the loaded `stack`** with just that native-pixel region
  (`makeCroppedStack()`, MODULE: in/out) rather than filtering an existing
  result: Localize, scrubbing, FTM, calibration, PCFO all then only ever see
  the cropped region, the same way they'd see any smaller loaded file — real
  speed-up, not a display filter, and logged (`Cropped to x…`). Same
  click-two-corners/toggle-to-undo interaction as `cropBtn`, but deselecting
  restores the *original* stack (kept in `originalStack` while a crop is
  active) rather than removing a table filter — see
  [§2](#2-module-reference)'s **in/out** entry and
  [§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `cropX0`/`cropY0`/`cropX1`/`cropY1`
  for the headless equivalent. Cropping/uncropping also re-estimates the
  Contrast slider below (see next) against the newly active stack, so it
  never keeps showing the range sampled from the frame size that was active
  before the crop.

  **Contrast** (below the Frame scrubber, Picasso-style) is a fixed
  [black,white] ADU display range — two overlapping range-slider handles
  (`#rawBlack`/`#rawWhite`) — applied identically to every frame, rather
  than the auto-stretch-per-frame most viewers default to (which makes
  brightness visibly shift as you scrub and lets one dead/hot pixel dominate
  a single frame's own min/max). It's initialised once per loaded stack from
  a bounded random sample of frames (for the slider's own outer bound) and
  frame 0's own actual min/max (for the initial handle positions); dragging
  either handle redraws instantly from the last-fetched frame's pixel data,
  no re-fetch. **Auto** (`rawContrastAutoBtn`) resets both handles back to
  that same estimate on demand. Purely a display convenience, local to the
  current session — deliberately **not** a `PARAMS` entry, not part of
  Save/Load Settings, and not exposed to the headless `analyze()` config
  (same carve-out as UI theme/panel-layout choice, [§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)).
- **SMLM reconstruction** (`sr` canvas) — the accumulated super-resolution
  render, or (before a Run) a quick averaged data projection, or the 3D
  calibration curve plot (`srIsPlot`). `calViewBtn` (next to the panel
  title, alongside every other reconstruction-panel view toggle — see
  below) cycles that plot between σ-width, phasor-magnitude, and
  phasor-ratio views (3D calibration only), labelled with whichever view
  clicking it switches TO.

### Log window

Every module writes its progress/results/warnings here (`log`) — the one
place to check what a Run, Calibrate, drift correction, NeNA/FRC, or a file
load actually did. `clearLogBtn`/`exportLogBtn` (grouped with the "Log"
title on the left of its own title bar) clear it or save it as a `.txt`
file; `layoutToggleBtn` sits on the right of the same title bar (see
**Header** above for what it does — it's placed here in the layout only for
spacing, not because it's log-specific). The single shared progress bar
(`#bar`/`#prog`, below the action buttons) is fed by every long-running
operation (Localize, Calibrate, drift, NeNA, FRC, file loads).

On every load, the page also compares the release number in the `<h1>`
pill against whichever version this browser last saw (`localStorage`'s
`webSMLM_lastVersion` — see **Header** above) and, if different, logs one
line — `webSMLM updated: vA.B.C → vX.Y.Z` — linking to the GitHub
changelog; a brand-new visitor just has the current version silently
recorded, no message. Ignores the `-dev`/build-letter suffix, so this only
fires on a genuine release change, not routine local development reloads.

**The log doubles as an interactive JavaScript terminal.** Directly below the
log text (now a fixed 12 lines tall, with its own scrollbar for anything
older) is a one-line, auto-growing input box, the same width as the log box
above it and outlined in the accent colour (no leading prompt glyph — the
outline itself marks it as a distinct, actionable control) — **Alt+T**
(either Shift state) jumps straight to it from anywhere on the page, the
same way Alt+1–0 reaches the top-level action buttons. Because almost every
action already logs a directly-runnable `analyze({...})` call, you can type
or paste a statement there and press **Enter** to run it live, in the page's
own context — including a line copied out of an exported `.txt` log from a
previous session. If what you ran returns a fresh set of localizations (the
same shape `analyze()` itself returns), the reconstruction, table, export,
drift/NeNA/FRC, and sSMLM/spt buttons all update immediately, exactly as if
you'd loaded that result interactively — this is what makes editing and
re-running a logged command actually useful, rather than just a curiosity.
**↑/↓** (only when the cursor sits on the input's first/last line, so moving
around inside a multi-line paste is unaffected) recalls previous statements
to edit before re-running — both ones typed here and every action's own
logged command, so arrow-up after a Localize or a committed filter brings
back that exact call, ready to tweak a parameter and rerun. On a touch
device with no physical arrow keys, two small **▲ History**/**▼ History**
buttons appear below the terminal (narrow-viewport layouts only) and do the
same thing. **Shift+Enter**
inserts a newline for a genuinely multi-line statement instead of running
early.

Most logged commands describe only what ONE action changed, not a full,
self-sufficient re-run — a committed filter or a crop, for instance, never
carries `file:` at all, since interactively they just act on whatever movie
is already loaded. Recalling one of those alone still works: the terminal
automatically fills in the file you most recently loaded or ran (and, if a
`file:`/`calibrationFile:`/`segmentationFile:` value refers to a file that's
still loaded this session by name, substitutes the real file back in for
it) — so "recall a crop or a filter, tweak a value, rerun" acts on your
current data the same way the crop tool or filter box already do, with no
need to re-select anything. If the referenced file genuinely isn't loaded
this session anymore, you'll get a clear error naming it rather than a
cryptic one.

**Any sidebar setting a recalled command doesn't mention works the same
way.** Only the "Load movie/data" command itself logs `pxnm`/`frametime`
explicitly, and most other commands (a crop, drift correction, NeNA/FRC,
sSMLM, spt, …) only ever log the handful of fields that ONE action actually
changed — never the whole settings panel. Recalling one of those from the
terminal still uses every OTHER setting exactly as currently configured
(method, PSF, thresholds, gain/offset, pixel size, frame time, and so on),
read live at the moment you press Enter, not whatever happened to be set
when that command was first logged. This is what makes correcting Pixel
size (nm) against a file's own metadata *after* loading, then recalling and
rerunning an earlier command, safe — the rerun picks up your correction
automatically, and likewise for switching fit method or any other setting
in between. Type a field explicitly into the terminal yourself (`pxnm:160`,
`psf:1.6`, …) and it overrides this, same as any other key in the command.

One thing to know about `analyze({...})` itself, if you type it fresh rather
than recall a logged line: for a movie file, it always runs the complete
load → detect/fit pipeline in one call — there's no "just crop," "just
correct drift," or "just estimate gain/offset" mode, since it's a one-shot,
no-interactive-session convenience built for CLI/pure scripting use. Typing
`analyze({cropX0:...})` yourself, for instance, will always ALSO run a full
Localize afterward. You mostly don't need to think about this, though: the
handful of actions where the button itself never Localizes anything — the
raw-panel crop tool, PCFO gain/offset estimation, drift correction, NeNA,
FRC, sSMLM preview/pairing, spt tracking, and **Load movie/data itself** —
already log the RIGHT thing to recall (e.g. `applyCropToRaw(x0,y0,x1,y1)`,
`correctDrift()`, `loadFiles(["movie.tif"])`, not an `analyze({...})`
line), so arrow-up after any of those just works, no substitution needed
and no surprise multi-minute re-Localize on a large stack.

**Load data (a `.csv`) and Simulate movie never had this issue at all**: a
`.csv` file takes a completely separate path inside `analyze()` that never
reaches the Localize step, so recalling a Load data command was always
exactly faithful; Simulate movie logs no command in the first place (there's
no `analyze()` equivalent for it), so there's nothing to recall via the
terminal for it either way — just call `runSimulation()` directly. This is
the general pattern covered next.

### Every GUI action has a matching terminal function

Nearly every button, checkbox, and control in this app is backed by one
plain, named JavaScript function — the exact same function the button's own
click handler calls — reachable from the terminal exactly the way
`analyze()` is. Typing that function's name reproduces the GUI action
precisely: same result, same log output, acting on whatever's currently
loaded. This is genuinely a design rule of the codebase, not a coincidence —
see the box below.

A representative sample (module order matches [§2](#2-module-reference)):

| GUI action | Terminal function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Load movie/data | `loadFiles(fileList)` | a `File` array/`FileList`; auto-detects CSV vs. movie |
| Load calibration… | `loadCalibrationJson(file)` | |
| Load settings | `loadSettingsJson(file)` | |
| Simulate movie | `runSimulation()` | no args — reads the current Simulation settings |
| Simulate calib. stack | `runCalibrationSimulation()` | no args — a bead z-stack, with calStep/calRef set for **Calibrate** |
| Preview PSF | `previewPsf()` | no args — builds (or reuses the cached) kernel from the Simulation PSF section |
| View GT localizations / Hide GT | `toggleGtLocalizations()` | needs a Simulate movie from this session |
| Debug: view single NUP | `showNupDebugView()` | temporary debug aid |
| **Localize** | `run()` | no args — reads the current sidebar settings live |
| Raw-panel crop tool | `applyCropToRaw(x0,y0,x1,y1)` / `uncropRaw()` | native-pixel bounds; does NOT localize |
| Reconstruction-panel crop tool | `commitSrCrop(x0,y0,x1,y1)` | **nm** bounds (not px) — a `_tableFilters` clause, not a stack crop |
| **Calibrate** | `runCalibration()` | |
| Fix bead x,y (checked/unchecked) | `locateBeadsForCalib()` / `clearCalFixedXY()` | |
| **Correct drift** | `correctDrift()` | |
| Compute NeNA / Compute FRC | `computeNeNA()` / `computeFRC()` | |
| Estimate gain/offset (PCFO) | `estimateGainOffset()` | |
| **Score vs truth** | `computeTruthScore()` | simulated data only; `cycleTruthPlotMode()` flips its raw-panel view |
| Preview pairs / Pair & plot sSMLM / Unpair | `previewSSmlmPairs()` / `runSSmlmPair()` / `unpairSSmlm()` | no standalone "Fit dist. & angle" any more — Preview pairs auto-fits internally |
| Show spectral/standard | `toggleSSmlmColorView()` | |
| **Track** (spt) | `runSptTrack()` | |
| Save track data | `exportSptSummary()` | |
| Show track data | `openTrackTable()` | |
| Load segm. image | `loadSegmentedImage(file)` | |
| Localize SOI (smFRET) | `locateSmfretSOI()` | |
| Pair DD + DA (smFRET) | `pairSmfretSites()` | no args — dispatches to `getSmfretPairingFromDonor()` (Via distances and angles) or `alignSmfretChannels()` (Via channel matching), whichever Pairing method selects |
| Get FRET data (smFRET) | `getSmfretTimeTraces()` | `getSmfretTimeTraces(true)` (the settings-toggle listeners' own call) keeps showing the current site/zoom instead of resetting to site 1; no standalone "E(S) histogram" button any more — a fresh run shows it automatically once a real DD+DA pairing exists (`showSmfretEHist()` itself still exists, terminal-callable, for re-showing it without recomputing traces) |
| Load FRET data (smFRET) | `loadSmfretTraces(file)` | reconstructs a saved trace session (including the pooled E(S) histogram thresholds, if the file has them) from a previously-exported JSON file — see `config.file`'s own paragraph above for how the terminal resolves a bare filename string back to a real File |
| Save FRET data (smFRET) | `exportSmfretTraces()` | no args — needs Get FRET data to have produced a result first |
| Show alignment/SOI composite (smFRET) | `toggleSmfretAlignOverlay()` | no args — only enabled once a "Via channel matching" **Pair DD + DA** run has built the alignment overlay |
| Fix SOI x,y (unchecked) | `clearSmfretFixSOI()` | |
| Show raw frame/time trace (smFRET) | `toggleSmfretTraceMode()` | |

| Connect (live streaming) | `liveStreamWsConnect()` | |
| Clear localizations (live streaming) | `clearLiveStreamingLocalizations()` | |

Pure display/cosmetic toggles (theme buttons, LUT/colour-map pickers, which
plot mode is showing, panel layout) are deliberately left out of this table
— they're one-line flag flips with no analysis behind them, not worth a
terminal shortcut. Everything that actually computes or changes data has an
entry here or follows the same `functionName(args)` pattern once you know
where to look — [§2](#2-module-reference) names the function behind almost
every control already.

A no-arg function like `estimateGainOffset()` reads its parameters straight
from the sidebar rather than taking them as arguments, so the logged command
sets each field to the value that was actually used, right before the call,
e.g.
```
$('pcfoFrames').value=200; $('pcfoK').value=0.9; $('pcfoRnstd').value=2.89; estimateGainOffset()
```
Recalling this (↑) loads the WHOLE line — field assignments and all — into
the terminal box already editable: change any number, press Enter, and it
sets that field then re-runs the action with it, no separate copy-paste
step. Setting a field this way doesn't fire its own `change` listeners
(the trailing call is what actually runs the action) — the same
"set the field, then call the action" idiom **Get from NeNA** already uses
for `sptLocError`. A key with no matching sidebar field (a bookkeeping
flag, a crop tool's own local coordinates, a loaded file's name) is left
out of the assignments and only affects the call's own arguments if it's
one already — e.g. `applyCropToRaw(120, 80, 640, 480)` needs no field
assignments at all, since crop bounds aren't sidebar fields to begin with.

A few things to know: the terminal only runs **JavaScript** — a line logged
in CLI style (`node webSMLM-cli.mjs --file ...`) won't work here; switch the
log to JS style first if you're copying from an exported log. A result run
this way has no live movie behind it, so raw-frame scrubbing stays
unavailable afterward — the same limitation a loaded CSV already has.
Pasting a whole block of several logged commands runs each one in sequence,
so an early line referencing a file that truly can't be resolved (a name no
longer loaded this session, or a calibration/segmentation file never loaded
at all) will stop the block with an error rather than skip ahead —
recalling and running one statement at a time is the intended way to use
it. And because this runs real code with full access to the page, treat it
the same way you'd treat any browser DevTools console: it's exactly as
powerful, and exactly as much your own responsibility.

## 2 · Module reference

Mirrors the `MODULE:` banners in `webSMLM.html`, in source order. Each entry
is what to know before touching that module, not a restatement of its code.

### PARAMS registry (`params`) {#params}

See [§3](#3-parameters-params-registry). `paramValue(id)` is
the only correct way to read a parameter (handles the DOM-control vs.
`paramOverrides` vs. registry-default fallback, plus int rounding).

### Load movie (`in/out`) {#in-out}

TIFF parsing. Bit depth (8/16/32-bit) and endianness are handled
automatically; 16-bit is preserved, never flattened to 8-bit. TIFF
headers are parsed first to get frame count/dimensions, then the decoded
working-set size is estimated (`frames × width × height × 4 bytes`)
against `memgb` to decide in-memory vs. streamed loading (`memgb`
budget); large (above ~4 GB) ImageJ stacks — where 32-bit TIFF offsets
can no longer address further, so the whole stack is written as a single
directory entry with every frame laid out contiguously after it — are
indexed arithmetically from that entry, unlike ordinary/multi-IFD
(Micro-Manager MMStack) stacks, which walk the IFD chain frame by frame —
never fully loaded, read via `File.slice()`. `loadTiffFilesAuto()` handles a multi-file
selection, auto-detecting which of two cases it is from the first
(naturally-sorted) file's own frame count: exactly 1 frame → every file is
one frame (`loadTiffSequence()`, natural-sorted and concatenated — e.g. a
per-frame camera dump); more than 1 → every file is its own chunk of ONE
continuous acquisition split across files purely by size (`makeConcatStack()`,
each file loaded normally via `loadTiffFile()` so it keeps whichever
strategy — in-memory/sliced/streamed — its own size calls for, then
concatenated end-to-end). No separate control for which case applies; it's
inferred automatically. Multi-file candidates are filtered by sniffing the
real TIFF magic bytes (`isTiffFile()`), not the filename extension — a
file merely *named* `.tif` isn't required, and a file that IS TIFF-formatted
underneath loads correctly regardless of its extension (`#file`'s `accept`
also lists `.nd2`, since a real sample turned out to be a mislabeled TIFF
export — see `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`'s ND2 entry); genuinely unparseable
content fails with a clear error (`loadTiff()` validates the raw
ImageWidth/ImageLength tags before trusting a decode) rather than
producing `NaN`-sized buffers downstream. Genuine native Nikon `.nd2`
binaries (not just the TIFF-in-disguise case above) are also supported —
`isNd2File()` sniffs the real magic bytes and `loadTiffFile()` dispatches
to a dedicated `loadNd2File()` parser, reaching the interactive `#file`
input, calibration file loading, and headless `analyze()`'s
`cfg.file`/`cfg.calibrationFile` alike with no extra wiring. Single
channel, 16-bit, uncompressed only; multi-channel or other bit depths
throw a clear unsupported-format error. Native **FITS** (`.fits`/`.fit`,
**experimental**) is supported the same way — `isFitsFile()` sniffs the
real `SIMPLE` magic and `loadTiffFile()` dispatches to `loadFitsFile()`,
reaching all the same call sites — for a camera-generated 2D image or 2D+
frame-axis data cube (a single-molecule movie exported by camera control
software such as Andor Solis, not an astronomical multi-extension file);
NAXIS other than 2/3, or a BITPIX outside the FITS standard's own 5 sample
formats, throws a clear unsupported-format error. No pixel size/frame time
is stored in this format — only camera/acquisition metadata (model, gain,
exposure, temperature) is logged. See **in/out** in `CLAUDE.md` for
the file-format details. `runFTM()` (optional, `ftmEnabled`)
runs right after either loader finishes, replacing `stack` with a fresh
`makeStack()`-backed one holding the temporal-median-corrected frames —
see [§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)'s FTM table for the full behaviour.
`makeCroppedStack(rawStack,x0,y0,x1,y1)` is the raw-panel crop tool's
(`rawCropBtn`) own wrapper, same idea: every fetched frame is sliced to
the `[x0,x1)×[y0,y1)` sub-rectangle, with that corner becoming the new
`(0,0)` — deliberately a full stack *replacement*, not a search-region
restriction threaded through detection/fitting, so nothing downstream
needs a coordinate offset added back; a smaller `stack` is indistinguishable
from having loaded a smaller file to begin with. No caching layer — each
fetch re-slices from whatever `rawStack` already does, so "uncrop"
(`originalStack`, kept only while a crop is active) and re-scrubbing both
just re-fetch from the original, same as the first load did. Composes for
free with everything above it (FTM wraps whatever `stack` currently is,
so cropping first then enabling FTM correctly runs the temporal median
over the smaller frames too) since nothing else in the codebase assumes a
particular frame size.

### Simulation settings (`simulation`) {#simulation}

The built-in synthetic stack generator ("Simulate
movie"). Demo/validation/teaching data, not a core analysis path. Emitters
follow a Poisson-process arrival/exponential-lifetime model over a
physical areal density (`dens`), run through a forward camera model
(shot noise → read noise → gain → fixed-pattern offset), decoupled from
the fit-side `gain`/`camoffset` so ground truth and the fit's assumed
camera can be matched or intentionally mismatched — see
[§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)/Simulation. Stores the true per-frame
drift (`simTrueDrift`) for scoring drift correction and the true emitter
events (`groundTruthEvents`), which **Score vs truth**
([§2](#validation)) compares the localizations against.

**Test structure** (`simulation_structure`) picks the object emitters attach
to. The original *Filaments + ring* stays the default, but note what it
cannot measure: one `sin(k·x+φ)` drives both a filament's y offset and its
z, so the two are perfectly correlated and a z error is indistinguishable
from a y error — and the sinusoid piles emitters up at the extremes of the
Z range, exactly where an astigmatic PSF stops encoding z uniquely. The
other five sample z independently:

| Structure | Geometry | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Tilted plane | z ramps linearly with x across the frame | bias, axial compression and the fold-back point, in one picture |
| Uniform 3D volume | x, y and z all uniform | unbiased accuracy-versus-depth statistics |
| Spherical shell | hollow sphere, radius `simulation_structureSize` | axial scale errors, visually — a sphere reconstructing flat (see the depth-mismatch scenario in [§2](#validation)) |

**The default object flatters nothing, but it does inflate the spread.**
Scored against ground truth at identical emitter density, *Filaments + ring*
gives a median lateral error of 22.7 nm where *Uniform 3D volume* gives 14.6 nm
— and that gap survives comparing only emitters at the same depth, so it is not
defocus. The cause is self-crowding: emitters lie along 1-D curves, so 15.3% of
them sit within 500 nm of another simultaneously-active emitter against ~7% for
the scattered structures, and overlapping PSFs are fitted with a single-emitter
model. Lateral *bias* stays under 1 nm for every structure, so the fitter is
unbiased either way. For accuracy figures, prefer **Uniform 3D volume**; for
diagnosis, **Tilted plane**.

**3D simulation?** (`simulation_3d`) means exactly one thing: whether z
varies. The structure is always built in 3D and its z simply flattened to 0
when the box is unticked, so the lateral geometry is identical either way
and every control, log line and plot applies unchanged in both states. With
it ticked *and* the Zernike PSF selected, each emitter is splatted from the
**nearest kernel z-plane**, so its depth is quantized to ± half the z step —
2.9 nm RMS at the 10 nm default, two orders below the fit's own axial error.
A two-plane linear blend was implemented and removed on measurement: blending
two PSF *intensities* is not interpolating the PSF's *width*, which is what an
astigmatic fit reads z from, so it cost 1.74× the simulation time for no
measurable gain at a fine z step and was measurably worse at a coarse one. The
rule left behind has no exceptions: a finer z step is more accurate, at a cost
paid once per kernel build and cached rather than per emitter per frame.

The PSF build reports how far either side of focus that PSF encodes z
**single-valued**, measured per plane with the same elliptical-Gaussian
fitter 3D calibration uses. Beyond it σ_y/σ_x turns back, two z values share
one width pair, and no width-based 3D fit can tell them apart — so Simulate
movie warns when the chosen structure reaches past it. At NA 1.4 / 660 nm
that limit is roughly ±450 nm (astigmatism weak), ±475 nm (moderate) and
±550 nm (strong), and zero for an unaberrated or purely spherical-aberrated
PSF, both being axisymmetric.

### Localisation settings (`detect`) {#detect}

Per-frame band-pass, one of three filters selectable via
`detFilter`: wavelet (default), DoG, or uniform box — each thresholded
differently (see [§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)/Detect). `detectSpots()`
is the single dispatch point used by both the main thread and workers.
DoG blurs each frame at a small scale (0.8×σ_PSF) and a large scale
(3×σ_PSF), subtracting the large-scale blur from the small-scale one —
`DoG = G(0.8σ) − G(3σ)` — removing flat background/slow gradients while
keeping PSF-sized spots; candidates are then strict 8-neighbour local
maxima above `mean + k·σ_noise` of the filtered image (σ_noise is the
filtered image's own spread, not σ_PSF).

### Localisation settings (`fit`) {#fit}

Phasor (fast, non-iterative), Gaussian least-squares, and
Gaussian Poisson-MLE 2D/3D (`gaussianMLEspheric`/`gaussianMLEelliptic`, the
default). All convert ADU→photons via `gain`/`camoffset` before fitting.
MLE fitters (and the LS ones — `gaussianFit`/`gaussianFitElliptical`) reject
a candidate outright (return `null`) rather than keeping a degenerate
result: not converged within the iteration budget, amplitude pinned at the
enforced floor (background mistaken for a spot), a non-finite CRLB
(singular Fisher matrix, MLE only), or the converged position drifting more
than `FIT_MAX_DRIFT_SIGMA_MULT` (2) times the seed σ_PSF from where it
started — deliberately independent of **Fit radius** (`winr`), which used
to also set this bound and so coupled "how much context to fit" to "how
strict the quality gate is"; see [§3](#fit-params) for the full story and
the reported issue it fixes. `gaussianMLEelliptic` also
returns `lpsx`/`lpsy` (fit precision of the σx/σy widths), consumed by
`zFromWidths()` to estimate `lpz` — an approximate z-precision via error
propagation through the calibration curve's local slope (not a true joint
CRLB, since z isn't a parameter of the pixel-level fit). A fifth method,
**Gauss MLE rotated elliptical** (`gaussmleEll`, `gaussianMLEellipticangled()`),
fits an independent σx/σy at either a FREE or a FIXED rotation angle,
chosen by the **3D localisation** checkbox (`localize3D`, shown for this
method and `mle3d`, default checked — see
[§3](#3-parameters-params-registry)): checked = FREE angle (a genuine
per-emitter rotation, recovered by the fit itself — useful as an
astigmatism-axis-alignment diagnostic against real 3D calibration bead
data) plus z from a loaded `gaussian_width` calibration, exactly like
`mle3d`; unchecked = angle FIXED at the sSMLM pairing step's own
calibrated dispersion bearing (`sSmlmAngleCenter`,
[§3/sSMLM](#ssmlm-params)),
no z — the original sSMLM-only path, for a spectrally-elongated 1st-order
PSF. Renamed from "Gaussian MLE Elliptical (sSMLM)"; `mle3d`'s own UI
label is now **Gauss MLE elliptical** (`gaussianMLEelliptic()`, axis-
aligned) and `gaussmle`'s is **Gauss MLE spherical**
(`gaussianMLEspheric()`) — matching Picasso's own SPHERICAL/ELLIPTIC/
ROTATED naming, no change to the underlying fit math from the rename
itself. `mle3d` also respects `localize3D`: unchecked, it runs the same
axis-aligned elliptical fit with no calibration requirement and no z —
just a 2D elliptical fit reporting σx/σy directly (see the CSV
`sigma_x`/`sigma_y [nm]` columns, [§6](#6-csv-export-format)). Either
way, use **Pair & plot sSMLM** afterward to get real per-axis widths for
both the 0th and 1st order of an sSMLM pair, not just the plain
symmetric-σ proxy every other method reports.
`gaussianMLEspheric`/`gaussianMLEelliptic`/`gaussianMLEellipticangled` all share one
Fisher-scoring Newton driver (`mleNewtonFit()`) rather than three
independently-coded copies. On the built-in synthetic model at 900
photons/emitter, Phasor reaches ~19 nm precision and Gaussian LS ~16 nm
(figures for that synthetic model specifically — real data depends on
your own photon count, background and PSF; Phasor's speed advantage over
either Gaussian method is covered in the **Fit method** popup above).
`pcfoCore()` is a
separate, one-off tool living in this module: Rieger–Heintzman PCFO
gain/offset estimation from a loaded/simulated stack directly (no
calibration acquisition needed) — see
[§3/Gain-offset estimation (PCFO)](#pcfo-params). Its
interactive wrapper is `estimateGainOffset()` (the **Estimate** button;
`transferPcfoEstimate()`, the separate **Transfer estimates** button, then
applies the result to `gain`/`camoffset`); `pcfoCore()` itself is DOM-free,
same `*Core(config, stack,
hooks)` split as `runCore`/`driftCore`/`calibrationCore`, reachable
headlessly via `config.estimateGainOffset` ([§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)).

### Rendering settings (`render`) {#render}

Accumulates localizations into an offscreen buffer `srFull`;
a `view` (zoom/pan) transform draws the visible region + scale bar. Colour
maps, blur and display scaling apply without refitting. `srIsRecon` tracks
whether `srFull` is the real per-localization reconstruction (vs. the
pre-Run data projection or a calibration bead composite) — gates the crop
tool and the nm-per-pixel conversion (`srNmPerPx()`).

`renderSuperRes()`'s accumulator buffers are DENSE — one value per
super-resolution pixel across the *whole* `(w×mag)×(h×mag)` grid,
regardless of how many localizations there actually are (500 locs and 5
million locs allocate the identical buffer size for a given frame size +
Magnification) — so memory scales as **O(frame area × mag²)**, entirely
decoupled from data volume. `checkRenderSize()` runs before any
allocation and throws if either side would exceed `CANVAS_MAX_DIM`
(16384 px — a hard per-browser canvas-creation limit, not a soft budget)
or if the estimated peak concurrent footprint (the count accumulator +
an optional z-accumulator with `zcolor` + `blur()`'s own transient
dst/tmp scratch with `rblur>0` + the final `ImageData` output + the
canvas's own backing store) exceeds `memBudgetGB` — the opt-in Total
memory budget (§3, Memory & streaming; default unset, so this check is a
no-op until one is configured), a genuinely separate setting from `memgb`
(the stack-loading cache/stream threshold). `rerender()` (interactive) catches the throw,
logs what to change (lower Magnification, crop the region, or raise the
budget), and leaves whatever reconstruction was already on screen in
place rather than blanking the panel or crashing the tab; the headless
`analyze()` path does not catch it, letting it propagate — the same
"throws immediately" precedent its other preconditions (e.g. a
too-small crop region) already follow.

The count accumulator (`acc`) is a `Uint16Array`, not `Float32Array` — a
per-pixel hit count is always a non-negative integer, so this halves
that buffer's footprint at no precision cost; `zacc` (a *sum* of z
values in nm, genuinely fractional) stays `Float32Array`. A plain
`Uint16Array` silently *wraps* past 65535 on overflow rather than
clamping, which would otherwise corrupt density data on an extreme
pile-up (many tens of thousands of localizations landing on the exact
same reconstructed pixel) — the increment is guarded explicitly
(`if(acc[idx]<65535) acc[idx]++`, else count it as saturated) and a
single warning is logged per render if any pixel actually saturates,
rather than risking that silent corruption.

### Worker dispatch (`workers`) {#workers}

Frame-parallel detect/fit. Workers are **not** separate
files: `workerSource()` builds worker code by stringifying the exact
functions the main thread uses, so any module-level `let`/`const` a
stringified function reads must also be re-declared in `WORKER_PRELUDE`, or
the worker throws and silently falls back to single-threaded. Batch sizing
is controlled by the `workerBatch*`/`workerMin*` params above.

### Localisation settings (`export`) {#export}

ThunderSTORM-compatible CSV, see [§6](#6-csv-export-format).
`photons`/`bg`/`bgstd` are already true photon units by the time they
reach export (conversion happens inside the fit) — export does no further
conversion, only warns when gain/offset look like they were never set.

### 3D calibration (`3D calibration`) {#3d-calibration}

Astigmatic σ_x/σ_y-vs-z curves from a bead z-stack;
astigmatism is the only 3D method implemented (Double Helix/Biplane would
live here too, per `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`). Every bead is fit both by LS
(real σ_x/σ_y) and phasor (magnitude ratio), so a saved calibration file
can carry both models, tagged, with a guard stopping a 3D fit from running
against the wrong one. **Fix bead x,y** (`calFixedXY`) freezes each bead's
lateral position from a composite of the calibration range before fitting
widths per frame — see [§7](#7-calibration-json-format).

### Drift correction (`drift`) {#drift}

Two drift-ESTIMATION methods (`driftMethod`), sharing one
downstream "apply the estimated per-frame shift to localizations"
implementation (`driftCore()`) regardless of which produced it.

**AIM** (adaptive intersection maximization), point-based, no
FFT, 2D+z — needs real localizations to already exist. Segments
localizations in time (`driftSeg`), grid-searches the
shift that maximizes coincident localizations against the accumulated
reference (`driftRoi`), then a parabolic sub-pixel peak refine. Two
internal rounds run automatically on every **Correct drift** click (not a
user-facing repeat step): round 1 chains each segment to the previous
one's own already-corrected position; round 2 re-checks every segment
against a SINGLE combined reference built from all segments together, so a
chain-accumulated round-1 error can still get caught. Round 2 scores each
segment with a leave-one-out reference (`subFrom()`/`addTo()` around
`bestShift()` in `aimDrift2D()`/`aimDriftZ()`) — earlier, the reference
included the segment's own contribution, which always scored as the best
possible match regardless of whether round 1 had actually gotten that
segment right, silently reducing round 2 to a no-op
([issue #9](https://github.com/HohlbeinLab/webSMLM/issues/9), Hazen
Babcock). AIM's own final per-frame drift is zero-MEAN referenced (an
arbitrary but self-consistent constant offset across the whole result,
irrelevant to a reconstruction's own image quality).

**Cross correlation** (`correlationDrift2D()`), image-based — works
directly off the raw movie, no Localize needed to ESTIMATE the drift
(applying a correction still needs existing localizations, same as AIM).
Averages `driftSeg` raw frames into one representative image per segment,
then finds each segment's own (dx,dy) shift relative to the FIRST segment
via FFT-based cross-correlation (`fft2d()`, the same radix-2 implementation
FRC already uses, applied here to a zero-padded, mean-subtracted camera
frame rather than a rendered reconstruction) with a parabolic sub-pixel
peak refine, mirroring AIM's own. Deliberately a single round against a
fixed reference, not AIM's own two-round refinement — re-doing that would
need sub-pixel-shifting and re-summing whole images per iteration rather
than just re-weighting point counts in a hash map. Unlike AIM, this
method's own per-frame drift is anchored EXACTLY to frame 0 (never
zero-mean re-referenced) — segment 0 is always the fixed reference by
construction, so frame 0's own drift is always exactly zero, a real,
absolute anchor rather than an arbitrary one; this is what makes it usable
as a genuine "where does a fixed reference position sit right now"
lookup, e.g. by **Time traces and FRET**'s own **Apply drift correction**
(see [§2](#smfret)).

### Ground-truth scoring (`validation`) {#validation}

Compares the localizations against the simulator's own ground truth — the
question a synthetic dataset exists to answer, and one webSMLM recorded the
data for but never asked. **Score vs truth** (Localization precision panel)
is enabled only for data generated in the same session; there is no ground
truth for a loaded file.

Reports detection quality (recall, precision, Jaccard), lateral bias and
RMSE, and — for a 3D run — axial bias and RMSE, with a left-panel plot in
three views: axial bias against **true** depth with a ±RMS band and the
lateral RMS alongside, fitted-z against true-z with the *y = x* line, and a
lateral-error histogram. The fitted-versus-true view is where a
non-invertible z shows itself: the cloud stops following the diagonal and
folds back.

Matching is per frame, **lateral only**, one localization to one emitter,
within **Match radius**. Matching on z as well would pair towards whichever
candidate has the flattering z and bias the axial error towards zero — the
very quantity being measured. It also means a 2D fit method, or a 2D
simulation, produces the same detection and lateral figures through the same
code, simply without the axial ones.

Positions are compared **before** drift correction, against ground truth
that carries the simulated drift, so the score describes the *fitter*
whatever drift correction did or did not do afterwards; drift correction has
its own ground-truth score in [§2](#drift).

**What counts.** A ground-truth emitter-frame is one of three things, not two. It is *counted*
when it delivered at least **Min photons/frame** (100) in that frame and lies outside the **Edge
exclusion** zone the fitter cannot reach (−1 = the Run's own detection border): matched is a hit,
unmatched a miss. Otherwise it is *don't care* — detecting it is neither a hit nor a false
positive, missing it is not a miss — and out-of-focus haze emitters are always don't-care.
Matching still runs against **all** ground truth first and classifies afterwards; filtering first
would turn a genuine detection of a dim emitter into a false positive. Setting Min photons and Edge
exclusion to 0 reproduces the pre-2026-09-19 numbers exactly.

**Per molecule.** Alongside the per-emitter-frame figures, the score groups matched pairs by the
simulator's own `moleculeId` and reports what fraction of counted molecules were found *at least
once*, how many times each was found, and how far off the **average** of those localizations
lands. That last number is the gain repeat blinks actually buy, which a per-frame median cannot
show. Measured on the 2D reference run: molecule recall 87.0% against 81.6% per frame, 1.8
detections per molecule, and the averaged position 4.63 nm off against 5.03 nm per single frame —
short of the 1/√1.8 the counting argument suggests, because most molecules are found once and the
median over molecules is dominated by them.

**Effective z range.** In 3D the score also reports the widest *contiguous* depth span where
recall stays at or above 50% — the honest answer to "how deep does this work", and one neither the
axial median nor the RMSE can give, since both are computed over the emitters that *were* found
and therefore improve as the fitter gives up. It is shaded in the **z error vs depth** view.
Contiguous rather than the union of good bins on purpose: two good bands either side of a dead
zone is a different and worse thing than one deep band.

It is a *detection* criterion, not an accuracy one, and the two genuinely differ: on one
astigmatic run the effective range came to ±559 nm while the same PSF encodes z single-valued only
to ±460 nm (the figure `buildPsfKernelStack()` reports). Between those two numbers emitters are
still found, but two depths share one width pair, so their z can fold to the wrong side. Read the
effective range together with that one.

**Two conventions.** **Convention** = `Challenge 2016` writes four ordinary settings
that together reproduce the rules the challenge's own assessment code uses (Sage et al.,
*Nat. Methods* 16, 387, 2019), so webSMLM's Jaccard and RMSE can be laid beside published numbers:
candidates sorted by 3D distance inside a 250 nm × ±500 nm cylinder instead of laterally; the
photon threshold as *the dimmest 25% of emitter-frames* instead of a fixed count; and the border
cut from truth **and** localizations before matching instead of settled afterwards. The defaults
stay webSMLM's own.

Measured on one scored 2D run, the same localizations score **Jaccard 0.812** our way and **0.976**
the challenge's way, and almost all of that gap is the threshold: the 25% quantile lands at 541
photons here, while our absolute default counts everything above 100 — including the emitter-frames
the detector cannot see (its 50% point is ~440 photons). Switching only the matcher moves Jaccard
0.812 → 0.817 but raises the lateral RMSE 15.9 → 20.3 nm, because the full candidate list rescues
pairs the nearest-neighbour matcher dropped and those rescued pairs are the far ones. Switching
only the border handling changed 2 localizations.

**Why `lateral` remains the default.** A hand-built case makes the trade concrete: two truths, and
localizations 0.02 px away laterally but 600 and 900 nm off in z, plus one 0.1 px away and 50 nm
off. Lateral matching reports 2 hits with axial errors of 600 and 900 nm; the cylinder refuses
those pairs and reports 1 hit with an axial error of 50 nm. Neither is wrong — but the cylinder's
axial gate flatters the axial error by construction (pairs that would have been scored as bad z
become misses instead), which is exactly the number a 3D method is being judged on. Read the
challenge convention for comparability, the default for measuring your own fitter.

Only the frames the Localize run covered are scored: its **First/Last frame to fit** range, or up to
its last localization if it was stopped (for a loaded CSV, which has no run behind it, the frames
the localizations span). Before build 2026-09-19f the whole movie was always scored, so a run
restricted to part of it counted every emitter outside that part as missed.

This matters because an emitter's ON period almost never lines up with frame boundaries, so a
large share of emitter-frames are slivers holding tens of photons. But it is only half the story
of the ~77% recall every fit method used to show, and the **Show vs photons** view (recall and
median lateral error against the photons an emitter put into the frame, log-spaced) shows the
other half: on the default detector (wavelet, k = 4, background 5 photons/px) detection crosses
50% at about **440 photons** — the log reports this figure for every score — and reaches 96–99%
only above ~600. Emitters between the counting threshold and that point are too dim to find but
bright enough to count; they are a real sensitivity limit, which the threshold deliberately does
not hide.

An **isolated/crowded** split reports emitters that had another counted emitter ON within
**Crowding radius** (300 nm) in the same frame separately: on one run, 5.0 nm median lateral at
82% recall isolated against 23.0 nm at 50% crowded — overlapping PSFs going through a
single-emitter fit. The **challenge efficiency** of Sage *et al.*, *Nat. Methods* 16, 387 (2019)
— E = 100 − √((100 − Jaccard%)² + α²·RMSE²), α = 1 nm⁻¹ lateral, 0.5 nm⁻¹ axial — is reported for
comparability with published benchmarks only, since it leans on RMSE (next paragraph).

**Read the median, not the RMSE.** The axial error distribution has heavy
tails: a few localizations land past the PSF's fold-back or on a clamped
calibration edge and are wrong by hundreds of nm. On a typical run the worst
1% of pairs — 4 out of 385 — contributed 62% of the sum of squares, and across
seeds the RMSE swung between 67 and 420 nm while the median barely moved.
Both are reported, along with a count of gross axial failures, but the RMSE on
its own describes the failures rather than the method.

#### The scenario worth running: calibration/sample depth mismatch

The single most useful thing this scoring reveals needs no new settings, only
a deliberate mismatch — and it reproduces the failure that silently corrupts
real 3D data. Calibrate on beads at the coverslip (**Emitter depth into
sample** = 0, then *Simulate calib. stack* → *Calibrate*), then raise the depth
to, say, 2000 nm and simulate a movie there. Imaging into a lower-index sample
through higher-index immersion shifts and aberrates the PSF, and the
calibration no longer describes it:

| | calibration = sample | sample 2 µm deeper |
|---|---|---|
| axial scale (fitted z vs true z) | 0.99 | **0.65** |
| median axial error | 22 nm | **243 nm** |
| Jaccard | 0.76 | 0.72 |

The z scale is 35% wrong while detection looks nearly unaffected — nothing in
an ordinary analysis would flag it. Note the measured 0.65 is well below the
paraxial `ns/ni` = 0.88: the Gibson-Lanni model's focal shift is not simply
that ratio, and the added aberration degrades the width→z mapping on top of
the scale error. Run the same scenario with **Spherical shell** to see it
rather than read it: the sphere reconstructs as a flattened ellipsoid.

### Localization precision (NeNA & FRC) (`locprecision`) {#locprecision}

NeNA (nearest-neighbour precision, Endesfelder fit)
and FRC (Fourier ring correlation image resolution, inline radix-2 FFT).
Marked **experimental**, not yet cross-validated against established
tools. FRC's sampling grid size is derived from a 3-tier fallback (NeNA
precision σ/2 → per-localization-precision histogram mode → reconstruction
pixel size), with NeNA rejected if implausibly larger than the mode tier
(a sign clustering has removed the genuine repeat-detection pairs NeNA
needs, letting its fit latch onto inter-molecule spacing instead).

### Pairing (sSMLM & FRET) (`sSMLM`) {#ssmlm}

Spectrally resolved SMLM: a diffraction grating in the
emission path splits each emitter into a 0th (undispersed) and a 1st-order
PSF, offset by a wavelength-dependent distance at a fixed, known
orientation; pairing them per frame recovers the emitter position, with
the distance itself a wavelength proxy. Ported from
[`HohlbeinLab/sSMLMAnalyzer`](https://github.com/HohlbeinLab/sSMLMAnalyzer)
(ImageJ/Java + MATLAB) — see Martens, Gobes, Archontakis, Brillas,
Zijlstra, Albertazzi & Hohlbein, *Nano Lett.* **22**(21), 8618–8625 (2022),
[10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03140](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03140).
`sSmlmCandidates(locs, px, distMin, distMax, angleCenter, angleTol,
onProgress)` enumerates same-frame candidate pairs within the given
distance window and within `angleTol` of `angleCenter` OR
`angleCenter+180°` (either point could turn out to be the upstream one —
see below), returning both the undirected line angle/deviation (`angle`,
`dAngle`, `sAngle` — what **Preview pairs**' diagnostic histogram plots)
and the raw, unfolded, directed bearing (`rawAngle`) `pairCore` needs.

Role assignment (which point of a candidate is 0th vs 1st order) is
**directional, not brightness-based** — an earlier version required the
paired point to be dimmer (physically plausible: the grating splits each
emitter's intensity), but real-data investigation found photon count
barely correlates with which side of a pair is which (≈50/50 even at
confident intensity gaps, most likely PSF-overlap/crowding corrupting
photon estimates at real emitter densities — a hypothesis that a genuinely
symmetric ±1st-order signal explained the same data was also tested and
ruled out, since the "wrong-side" population's intensity-*ratio* profile
turned out statistically indistinguishable from the real side, which a
genuinely weaker physical order shouldn't produce). `sSmlmAngleCenter` is
therefore a genuine SIGNED bearing (full ±180°) — the 1st order's fixed
direction from its 0th order, the same for every emitter in the image —
rather than an undirected line. `pairCore(locs, px, config, hooks)`
classifies each candidate by comparing its `rawAngle` to `angleCenter`:
whichever point is upstream on that bearing is the 0th-order candidate,
the other its 1st. A point only qualifies as 0th order if it has **at
least one** such outgoing candidate **and zero** candidates on the
*opposite* bearing (which would mean it looks like it could itself be
sitting where a 1st order would be, i.e. more likely someone else's 1st
order than a genuine 0th) — self-disqualifying, no external reference
signal needed. Closest-to-expected-bearing wins any remaining ties when a
single downstream point is claimed by more than one qualifying upstream
candidate. This was verified against the real reference dataset to
recover *more* pairs than the old brightness-gated approach (64.0% vs
59.0%), with only ~5% of points landing in the genuinely ambiguous
"candidate on both sides" bucket it correctly excludes — and a
mean-position sanity check (mean of all accepted 0th-order positions vs.
mean of all their matched 1st-order positions) reproduces the configured
~2500 nm/~2° separation almost exactly, confirming the pairs found are
self-consistent rather than an artifact. PSF width (σ) showed only an
imperfect ~65–70% correlation with role (consistent with the 1st order's
spectral smearing broadening its PSF relative to the undispersed 0th) —
too unreliable to gate on, so it isn't used as a filter at all, only
reported (`sigma1st`, below).
**2-point pairs only for now**
(0th+1st) — multi-order chaining, and FFT-based automatic angle/distance
detection (`sSMLMAnalyzer`'s `AngleAnalyzer.java` renders localizations to
an image and 2D-FFTs it to find the dominant periodic peak), are tracked
as follow-ups in `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, not implemented here — the
**Preview pairs** distance/angle histograms cover the same "find my
window" need more simply for a first version, verified against a real
~2M-localization reference dataset (`experimental_data/README.md`) before
building the rest around it. A localization that finds no partner within
the window is dropped from the result entirely — the output only ever
contains accepted pairs. Each accepted pair's reported position is the
**0th order's own** x/y, not the midpoint between the two: the 0th order
is undispersed, so its centroid already IS the emitter's true image
position, while the 1st order sits a wavelength-dependent (i.e.
emitter-to-emitter varying) distance away — averaging the two would blur
position by up to half that spectrally-varying offset instead of reporting
it precisely. Each paired row also carries `sigma1st` — the 1st order's own
`sigma` (`locs[e.down].sigma`, threaded through rather than discarded), exported as
a `sigma1st [nm]` CSV column (see §6) and shown as a `sigma1st` table
column (see §5) whenever present — not a directional/long-axis width, since
no 2D fit method computes one, but the closest available proxy for how much
wider the spectrally-smeared 1st order looks vs. the 0th. Every paired row
also keeps the 1st order's own raw position and the pair's own directed
compass bearing, as `x2`/`y2`/`pairAngle` — previously computed at the
candidate stage purely to derive `dist`/the angle deviation, then
discarded; now threaded through `pairCore()` alongside `dist`. Named
`pairAngle` and not `angle`, deliberately: a plain `angle` field already
exists on a loc from `gaussianMLEellipticangled`'s own fitted ellipse
rotation, in RADIANS — reusing the name for this DEGREES-valued pair
bearing would silently corrupt that column for any result that also
carries a real per-loc ellipse angle. `x2 [nm]`/`y2 [nm]`/`pairAngle [deg]`
are optional CSV/table columns, present whenever any loc carries them (see
§5/§6) — this is what lets smFRET's own **Get FRET data** read a real,
independently-known acceptor position for **DA**/**AA** once a pairing
exists (see **Time traces and FRET** below), rather than only ever having
the 0th order's own position to work with. Pairing stores
the inter-order distance in its OWN `dist` field — deliberately **never**
`z`, an earlier design that aliased `z` was reverted (2026-08-17) so a
future 3D-fit + sSMLM combination could carry real depth AND spectral
distance on the same loc without one overwriting the other; `pairCore()`
never even sets `z`. The **render** module's `renderSuperRes()`/`zRange()`
take an explicit `colorField` (`'z'` or `'dist'`) instead of hardcoding
`.z`, so the same depth-coded path colours by either; the interactive
wrapper and `analyze()` (see §8) each derive it as `hasZ ? 'z' : (hasDist ?
'dist' : null)` — only one is ever reachable today, but the seam is real.
This split also fixed a genuine bug: drift correction's "Correct z too
(3D)" option used to key off the same check the colour toggle used, so a
paired result could show it and — if ticked — silently 1-D-"correct" its
spectral `dist` as if it were spatial depth; drift's z-row/gate is keyed on
real `z` alone now, never `dist`, which can't happen once the fields are
genuinely independent. **`pairCore()` itself throws** (not just the
interactive wrapper — every caller, headless included, gets the same
protection) if the input already has real 3D `z`, OR already has a `dist`
field (i.e. is already-paired output); the second guard is new alongside
the split — with `z` no longer touched by pairing, re-pairing an
already-paired result can no longer be caught as a side effect of the
z-guard the way it used to be. `runSSmlmPair()`/`unpairSSmlm()` swap
`lastResult.locs` for the paired/original set. Three
module-level variables track pairing state: `sSmlmOriginalLocs` is the TRUE
raw/unpaired backup, captured once on the first successful Pair (the same
pattern the raw-panel crop tool uses for `originalStack`) — it is also the
*authoritative pairing input*: Preview/Pair always compute from
`sSmlmOriginalLocs || lastResult.locs`, never from `lastResult.locs`
directly, since that may currently BE the already-paired subset (pairing
or previewing against an already-paired set would search for 1st-order
companions among points that no longer have any).
`sSmlmPairedLocs` is the most recent successful Pair result, replaced on
every re-Pair without touching `sSmlmOriginalLocs`. `sSmlmShowingRaw`
tracks which of the two is currently assigned to `lastResult.locs`. The
**table** module's `locTableData()` shows `dist` and `z` as independent,
optional columns (present whenever any loc has a finite value), not one
aliasing/relabelling the other. **Pair & plot sSMLM** also turns on `zcolor`
and sets `zmin`/`zmax` to the *configured* `sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmDistMax`
(not `rerender()`'s usual 1st–99th-percentile auto-fit) — every accepted
pair's distance is already within that window by construction, so it's the
natural colour-scale range, and it re-syncs on every Pair (e.g. after
narrowing the window post-calibration-fix).

The button itself (labelled **Pair & plot sSMLM**, renamed to make clear it
does both) is split internally into a pure(ish) pairing step, `pairSSmlm(cfg,
myEpoch)` — runs `pairCore()` and applies the result to
`sSmlmOriginalLocs`/`sSmlmPairedLocs`/`lastResult.locs`, nothing else — and
the interactive wrapper `runSSmlmPair()`, which calls it then does the
"plot" half described above (z-range, LUT switch, rerender). Likewise
**Preview pairs** splits into `previewSSmlmPairsCore()` (the candidate scan
+ automatic distance/angle fit) and the wrapper `previewSSmlmPairs()` (which
additionally shows the histogram). This split exists so the **smFRET**
module's own **Pair DD + DA** button ([§2](#smfret)) can preview-and-pair
the sites of interest *silently* — no raw/SR panel view switch, no LUT/
z-range/rerender — reusing exactly these two DOM-light halves rather than a
separate implementation.
`syncSSmlmZRangeFromDist()` keeps this live even *without* re-pairing: a
`change` listener on `sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmDistMax` re-applies the same
`zmin`/`zmax` assignment and calls `rerender(true)` whenever those fields
change while the paired ("spectral") view is showing — a no-op before the
first Pair, and while the "standard" (raw) view is toggled on, since
neither has a colour scale to update. A "Show spectral"/"Show standard"
button inline in the reconstruction panel title (`sSmlmColorBtn`, same
pattern as the raw panel's FTM toggle) genuinely swaps which loc set is
drawn — `lastResult.locs = sSmlmShowingRaw ? sSmlmOriginalLocs :
sSmlmPairedLocs`, plus `zcolor` set to match — not just the colour flag;
"Show standard" shows the literal unpaired reconstruction (the same data
Unpair would restore), without discarding the pairing the way Unpair does,
so toggling back to "Show spectral" is instant. The Colour map switches
too, the same `sSmlmPrevLut` stash/restore **Pair & plot sSMLM**/**Unpair** already use:
switching to "Show spectral" stashes whatever Colour map Standard was
using and sets it to `hsvBlue`; switching back to "Show standard" restores
it — without this, the unpaired (standard) reconstruction, which has no
colourable field at all, rendered through `hsvBlue` as a confusing
blue-dominant density map instead of a plain one. Paired locs are already
`lastResult.locs` while shown, so the top-level **View data/filtering**
button works on them directly — no separate table for sSMLM. **Headless**
(v0.11.1): `config.sSmlmPair` runs pairing right after Localize, before
drift/NeNA/FRC; `config.sSmlmPreview` (v0.12.1-dev) runs Preview pairs' own
wide diagnostic scan independently of it — see §8 for both.

### Time traces and FRET (`smFRET`) {#smfret}

Single-molecule FRET (donor/acceptor pair analysis) — **experimental**,
still v1 in scope (no E_raw/S_raw computation yet, see the end of this
section), but the actual pairing/read-out workflow — sites of interest
(SOI) detection, donor/acceptor pairing, ALEX-aware time traces, and a
cross-channel verification step — is now a complete, real pipeline,
extensively verified against real prism/polychroic ALEX data. First
sketched in `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md` ("Determine positions of interest = the
existing 'Fix bead x,y' pattern"). Not squeezed into the sSMLM or 3D
calibration modules — a genuinely different optical setup from sSMLM's own
diffraction-grating 0th/1st-order pairs (real data motivating this: a prism
+ polychroic beam-splitter splitting the emission spectrum, giving a pair
that is NOT a 0th/1st order in sSMLM's sense) and a different purpose from
3D calibration's own bead-position fixing — even though **Localize SOI**
reuses the exact same underlying mechanism, and pairing itself reuses
**Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)**'s own directional distance+bearing-angle
matching directly (see below).

**Analyse FRET** (`smfretFretEnabled`, default checked, right below **Average
# of frames**) makes explicit that this module is also a plain time-traces
tool, not only a FRET one — requested after noticing that analysing time
traces without ever pairing a FRET pair was "somewhat hidden" behind a
module named only for FRET. Unticking it disables/greys out **Pair DD + DA**
(the one control that only makes sense once a real donor/acceptor pair is
actually wanted); every other control — **Localize SOI**, **Get (FRET)
data**, **Load/Save (FRET) data** — stays fully usable regardless, since
none of them require a pairing to produce something meaningful. With
**Alternating-laser excitation** on and **Analyse FRET** off (no pairing),
**Get (FRET) data** still
plots real **DD** and **AA** (AA falls back to sampling at the site's own
position — see that control's own paragraph below) — there is simply no
donor→acceptor distance/bearing to derive an **E**/**S** value from, so the
**E(S) histogram** stays unavailable, exactly as it already is for any
other unpaired result. The three trace buttons carry a "(FRET)" in
brackets specifically to flag that pairing is optional, not a
prerequisite, without a more disruptive rename.

**Localize SOI** (`locateSmfretSOI()`, wrapping the pure `smfretSOICore()`)
averages the first **Average # of frames** frames (from frame 1, or —
with **Alternating-laser excitation** checked — only the donor- or only
the acceptor-excitation half, see below) of the loaded movie into one
stable composite via `averageFrames()`/`averageFramesByParity()`, runs
`detectSpots()` once on that composite, and fits each detected maximum via
`gaussianFitElliptical()` — byte-for-byte the same "average, then detect
once" approach `locateBeadsForCalib()` (3D calibration module) already
implements, not a reimplementation. `smfretSOICore()` is the pure,
DOM-free half — reused not just by the headless API but by **Link
channels** below, which calls it fresh, on demand, against the acceptor
channel specifically. The FIRST run is a manual button click; once an SOI
composite is showing, changing **Average # of frames** or any detection/fit
setting that would affect it (Threshold, σ_PSF, Window radius, detection
filter/its own threshold field, Exact ±3σ box) re-runs it automatically —
the same "always reflects the current settings" convention
`locateBeadsForCalib()`'s own listeners use, gated on `smfretSOI!==null`.
Real SOI signals are commonly faint, so this live feedback matters in
practice — finding them at all often needs the threshold hand-tuned down
from whatever a bright, well-separated dataset's default would suggest.
Results land in `smfretSOI` (`{x,y,sx,sy,sigma,photons,bg,bgstd,frame:0}`
per site — the fitter's own full output, not just position) and are shown
the same way a bead composite is: the composite image fills the
reconstruction (right) panel as `srFull`, with `srSpots`/`srLocs` driving
the ROI-box/fit-crosshair overlay (`drawSpotOverlays()`, MODULE: render) —
a reference view, not a real per-localization reconstruction
(`setSrRecon(false)`). Each site's 1-based index is drawn next to its ROI
box, same visual style as the **single particle tracking** module's own
track numbers (dark backing box, white text, size scaling with zoom) —
this numbering appears only on the SOI composite, not on 3D calibration's
own bead composite even though both share the same `drawSpotOverlays()`
call. Once a **Pair DD + DA** (or **Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)**'s own
**Preview pairs**/**Pair & plot sSMLM**) has actually committed a pairing,
every SOI entry that became part of a pair has its own ROI box/crosshair
recoloured dark orange instead — see the **Pairing** paragraph below for
the marking mechanism (`markSmfretSoiPairedKeys()`), which colours rather
than filters, so an unpaired site's box never simply vanishes.

Every successful run — the first click, or a later auto-rerun — also
writes `smfretSOI` into `lastResult` (`{locs:smfretSOI, w, h, px, mag,
det:null, fromSmfretSOI:true}`, the same minimal shape a loaded CSV uses
for locs with no real per-frame Run behind them), enabling **View
data/filtering**, **Save data**, and — the actual point — **Pairing
(sSMLM & FRET)**'s own **Preview pairs**/**Pair & plot sSMLM** (or the
**Pair DD + DA** shortcut below, which drives exactly those two
functions): sSMLM's directional distance+bearing-angle matching (built for
a diffraction grating's 0th/1st order) works just as well for a
dual-view/polychroic-split donor/acceptor pair, which is
translation-dominated the same way — no separate pairing implementation
needed. Every SOI site shares the SAME `frame:0` (an arbitrary constant,
not a real per-frame index) specifically so `sSmlmCandidates()`'s own
per-frame grouping treats the WHOLE SOI set as one pool, comparing every
candidate against every other one — correct for a position set with no
real temporal structure of its own. This replaces whatever `lastResult`
held before (a real Localize run, a loaded CSV, or an earlier SOI pass)
with no confirmation prompt, same convention `run()`'s own pre-Localize
reset uses — but it does warn (naming what's being cleared) the first time
it overwrites a REAL prior result, not on every routine auto-rerun
re-clearing its own previous SOI pass. Unchecking **Fix sites of interest
(SOI)** (below) discards this `lastResult` (and any pairing built from it)
the same way it discards the sites themselves — but loading a *different*
movie does NOT: only `smfretSOI` itself (positions genuinely scoped to the
OLD stack's own pixels) is cleared on a fresh load, the checkbox's own
state is left alone, since a plain load has no consequence for it until
**Localize SOI** actually runs again.
The panel's own zoom/pan is only reset on an actual frame-size change —
each auto-rerun keeps whatever view a user already zoomed/panned to,
the same "keep zoom while scrubbing" behaviour the raw (left) panel's
own live preview already has, so hand-tuning a threshold while zoomed
in on one faint candidate doesn't keep snapping back out to the full
field of view.
**Average # of frames** is clamped to the loaded movie's own frame count at
use (`Math.min(stack.n,...)`), the same convention `calFirst`/`calLast`
already use, rather than a dynamic HTML `max` attribute.

**Fix sites of interest (SOI)** (`smfretFixSOI`, default checked) is a
STATUS flag, not an independent on/off switch — every successful
`locateSmfretSOI()` run (explicit click or an auto-rerun above) checks it,
marking the current positions as the fixed reference **Get FRET data**
below will fit. Checking it by hand does nothing on its own (there's no
way to tell "just auto-checked" from "user clicked it", and the only state
worth reacting to is losing the positions, not gaining them); unchecking
it discards `smfretSOI` and any `smfretTraces` already built from it,
restores the reconstruction panel's general overview, and hides the site
scrubber (see below) in favour of the ordinary Frame one — the same
"uncheck to discard and restore the general view" convention 3D
calibration's own **Fix bead x,y** checkbox already uses, just without
that checkbox's own check-to-trigger direction. It also discards
`lastResult` itself (and any pairing built from it, above) whenever
`lastResult` is still the SOI result this module wrote — never a real
Localize/CSV-loaded result that happened to still be current, which SOI
already claimed the moment it first ran.

**Get FRET data** (`getSmfretTimeTraces()`) extracts every `smfretSOI`
site's intensity — using its known x,y only to pick which window to look
at, never re-detected by scanning the whole frame — in EVERY frame of the
loaded movie, by one of two methods selected by **Aperture photometry (no
fit)** (`smfretApertureMode`, default unchecked):

Unchecked (default): the standard 2D spherical Gauss MLE fitter,
`gaussianMLEspheric()` (MODULE: fit — the same fitter an ordinary Localize
run uses), **seeded** at the site's own rounded position but with x,y left
**free** to fit, not held fixed. An earlier version held x,y fixed
(`gaussianFitEllipticalFixedXY()`, still used unmodified by 3D calibration's
own **Fix bead x,y** mode) — changed on reported feedback: fixing position
only makes sense for calibration's own bright, well-isolated beads, where
the position is already known precisely; a faint smFRET candidate has no
such guarantee, since **Localize SOI**'s own position is only a
composite-image estimate, and on a frame where the molecule is genuinely OFF
there is no real PSF there to fit no matter where x,y starts. Seeding (not
fixing) x,y lets the fitter's own accept/reject logic do the right thing:
it rejects a fit that doesn't converge, collapses onto pure background,
converges to an implausibly narrow OR implausibly wide σ, or drifts too far
from its seed — precisely "no real molecule in this frame's window" —
instead of forcing a shape onto flat noise the way the fixed-position
least-squares fit did (diagnosed against real data: isolated single-frame
spikes with no corresponding brightness in the raw pixels at all). A REJECTED
fit reports **zero** intensity at that frame — a real, physically meaningful
judgement that no molecule was on, not missing data. Only a site too close to
a given frame's own edge (no window to even attempt a fit on) leaves a genuine
gap (`NaN`) rather than aborting the whole trace.

Checked: `apertureIntensity()` uses a published, previously-validated method
(pSMLM-3D's own Supplementary Information §S11, itself adapting Preus,
Hildebrandt & Birkedal 2016 — see [§9](#9-references-further-reading)) rather
than an ad-hoc box sum: a CIRCULAR signal disk (distance from the site's
rounded position ≤ `r=(win-1)/2`, the same half-width the fit would use) is
summed directly, and a separate, non-overlapping annulus just outside it
(`r` to `r+2.5` px) estimates the background via its 56th percentile (not a
mean or median). No iterative fit at all, so it always succeeds once a site
is far enough from the edge — there's no convergence to fail — at the cost of
not reporting a per-frame width. Recommended if a trace from the default
method still shows an implausible spike.

Both methods report properly gain/camoffset-corrected true photon units.
Many sites × many frames — most of
which won't contain a real localization for a given faint site, since
extraction still runs there regardless — can take a while, so this
reports real progress on the shared progress bar rather than leaving it
static for the whole run, the same convention **Track**/**Pair & plot
sSMLM**/**Correct drift**/**Calibrate** already use. Results land in `smfretTraces`
(`{x,y,photonsDD,photonsAA,photonsDA}` per site, each a `Float64Array(stack.n)`
or `null` when that channel doesn't apply — `photonsDD` is always present)
and replace the raw (left)
panel's live frame display with a plot of one site's own intensity-vs-frame
curve (`drawSmfretTrace()`) — the same "left panel doubles as a plot
surface" pattern drift/NeNA/FRC already use (`rawFull=null`,
`setRawPlot(true)`), 4:3 letterboxed via the shared `setupPlot()`. The
y-axis uses the same matplotlib-style offset notation (`axisScale()`) the
PCFO plot already relies on for its own large-value axis — full 5-6 digit
ADU tick labels otherwise visually collide with the rotated "intensity
(ADU)" axis title; ticks instead show small 1-2 digit numbers plus a single
`×10ⁿ` multiplier drawn once near the axis, at the same font size as the
tick labels/axis titles themselves. The x-axis is **time (s)**, computed
from **Frame time (s)** (`frametime`, starting from 0), not a raw frame
number — hovering the plot shows both the time and the underlying frame
index. While a
trace is showing, the raw panel's own Frame scrubber (`#scrubRow`) is
replaced by a dedicated **site** scrubber (`#smfretTraceScrubRow`) — mouse
wheel over its slider, or dragging the slider itself, steps through SITES
instead of frames, the same "another feature owns the raw panel" pattern
`liveStreamOwnsRawPanel()` already established for its own scrubber
(`smfretOwnsRawPanel()`, checked by the shared `scrubByWheel` routing). A
**"Show raw frame"/"Show time trace"** toggle next to the panel title
switches back and forth between the trace plot and the live raw frame (with
its own ordinary Frame scrubber) without discarding the computed traces —
useful for checking a trace against the actual frame it came from; switching
back to the trace returns to whichever site was showing before.

Before any pairing exists, only **DD** (at the SOI's own position) can be
sampled at all — there's no independently known acceptor position yet.
Once a site IS paired (**Pair DD + DA** below, or **Pairing (sSMLM &
FRET)**'s own **Preview pairs**/**Pair & plot sSMLM**), its real acceptor
position is already known from the pairing itself, so **DD** splits into
**DD** (at the donor position) and **DA** (at the paired acceptor
position, both read during donor-excitation frames — DA needs no ALEX at
all, a continuous single-laser setup still has every frame count as donor
excitation); with ALEX also on, **AA** is read at that SAME acceptor
position too, during direct-acceptor-excitation frames — the physically
correct channel/timing for direct acceptor excitation. `showAA`
(`getSmfretTimeTraces()`'s own gate on whether `photonsAA` is even
computed) is simply `alex && paired` — DA is unconditionally the leading
position for AA; there is currently no independent-AA-localization or
unpaired-own-position fallback (dropped, simplified, v0.12.1-dev — "DA is
the leading position for time traces to obtain time traces in the AA
channel").

The Time trace plot inserts a dedicated strip of small **ROI** thumbnails
(DD/DA/AA, only the ones that exist for the current site) directly below
its own x-axis, still inside the same canvas/panel — a contrast-stretched
crop of the real camera pixels around each channel's own extraction
position, one FIXED representative frame per channel (the first
donor-excitation frame for DD/DA, the first acceptor-excitation frame for
AA), not scrubbed with the main Frame slider. Each crop carries a magenta
crosshair at the EXACT fitted sub-pixel position used for that channel's
own extraction (not just the crop's rough centre), so a quick look answers
both "does this sit on a real molecule" and "did the fit actually land
where it should." Drawn directly onto the real raw-panel canvas (never
through the SVG-recording redirection **Save plot/image** uses for the
seven genuinely vector-shaped plots — a raster crop has no meaningful
vector form, same reasoning the raw frame/reconstruction are already
excluded from SVG export for) by an async, fire-and-forget
`drawSmfretRoiThumbnails()`, called at the end of every `drawSmfretTrace()`;
it guards against a scrub-away or a mode switch happening while its own
frame fetches are still in flight, so a slow fetch can't paint stale
insets over whatever the panel has moved on to. Update automatically when
scrubbing between sites.

Below the DD/DA/AA plot (and above the ROI thumbnail strip), a second
stacked plot shares the SAME time x-axis and shows the CURRENTLY SELECTED
site's own **E** (orange) and, once ALEX and AA data are both present,
**S** (teal) as a function of time, fixed to the conventional [0,1] range
— the per-site, time-resolved complement to the pooled, population-level
**E(S) histogram** below. Per-sample E/S use the same "each channel
strictly positive" requirement `smfretPoolE()`/`smfretPoolES()` use for
the pooled histogram (a rejected-fit 0, or a genuinely negative unfloored
value, on just one channel would otherwise clamp E/S to exactly 0 or 1),
with no burst-selection threshold — this is a diagnostic trace of one
site, not a burst-selected population. Before a pairing exists (no DA), it
shows a placeholder message instead of an empty plot.

**Headless**: `config.smfretLocateSOI` (v0.12.1-dev) runs the same
`smfretSOICore()` the interactive button calls — see [§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)
for the full config/result shape. **Get FRET data** has no headless
equivalent yet.

**Alternating laser excitation (ALEX)** — step one of the "ALEX frame-role
bookkeeping" prerequisite `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`'s own smFRET/ALEX sketch
calls out as needed before any DD/DA/AA/AD sorting can happen: just which
frames get direct donor- vs. direct acceptor-excitation, nothing more yet. **Alternating
laser excitation?** (default unchecked) reveals **First frame** — Direct
donor excitation or Direct acceptor excitation, i.e. which physical laser
the loaded movie's own first frame corresponds to. It affects TWO views in
the reconstruction panel, which share one toggle/state since they're
mutually-exclusive views of the same parity-restricted averaging: the
**Data projection** shown before any Localize/Calibration result exists
(`showStackProjection()`), and smFRET's own **SOI composite** once
**Localize SOI** has run (`locateSmfretSOI()`). Checked, the panel title
gains a toggle button (labelled with whichever state clicking it switches
TO — **Donor dir. exc.**/**Acceptor dir. exc.** for Data projection,
**DD+DA**/**AA** for the SOI composite) that averages only the even- or
only the odd-indexed frames (`averageFramesByParity()`, MODULE: in/out — a
parity-strict sibling of `averageFrames()`, which can't be reused directly
since its own evenly-spaced subsampling doesn't respect frame parity)
instead of the whole stack, so the two excitation channels can be
inspected — or, for the SOI composite, localized — separately. Checking
**Alternating-laser excitation** after a composite already exists
recomputes it automatically, rather than leaving it stale until some other
setting happens to trigger a refresh. Whenever either composite is showing,
a **Contrast** slider also appears next to the panel title, at the same
fixed `[black,white]` stretch the raw panel's own Contrast control uses —
useful since a real composite's own intensity range is rarely known in
advance. The raw (left) panel and every other analysis path (a real
Localize run, Get FRET data's own extraction, …) are untouched — this
family of controls only ever affects which frames get averaged into a
preview/detection composite, not per-localization channel sorting.

Toggling the SOI-composite channel view alone (**DD+DA**/**AA**) never
discards an already-committed pairing — `locateSmfretSOI()` takes a `preservePairing` flag,
set only from this toggle's own call site, that bails out right after
refreshing the composite/overlay but BEFORE resetting any pairing state;
re-detecting the SAME channel on the SAME frames with the SAME settings is
deterministic, so the existing dark-orange marking still matches the fresh
composite by value with no extra work. Toggling back and forth is
therefore a free, non-destructive way to compare the two channels without
losing anything already computed — a real, explicit **Localize SOI**
click is the only thing that genuinely starts over.

**Pairing a donor candidate to its acceptor partner** reuses **Pairing
(sSMLM & FRET)**'s own directional distance+bearing-angle matching
directly — `pairCore()`'s translation-dominated dual-view/polychroic case
is exactly the same math as sSMLM's own diffraction-grating case, just a
different physical origin for the offset — with zero pairing-specific code
of its own. **Pair DD + DA** (`getSmfretPairingFromDonor()`) is a
smFRET-side shortcut over that module's **Preview pairs** +
**Pair & plot sSMLM**, run directly against the current sites of interest:
it fits the distance/angle window (the SAME auto-fit **Preview pairs**
itself runs — see **Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)** above), redraws the raw
(left) panel with the resulting Distances/Angles histogram, and commits
the pairing (writing each site's paired acceptor position/distance into
`lastResult.locs`) — but skips that module's own RECONSTRUCTION-panel side
effects entirely (no colour-map switch, no z-range change, no re-render),
so it never disturbs whichever composite or time trace the reconstruction
(right) panel currently shows. With ALEX ticked, it always pairs the
**direct donor excitation** channel's own sites, refusing with a log
message if the SOI composite currently showing is the acceptor-excitation
one instead. The window it pairs with is always read AFTER its own
internal fit has actually run, not before — an earlier version captured it
first, so a first click always paired against a stale/default window and a
second click (now benefiting from the first click's own fit) produced far
more pairs; fixed by reordering, verified against the real reference
dataset. If the SOI composite is still showing when pairing succeeds,
every site that became the ACCEPTOR (DA) side of a pair has its own ROI
box/crosshair recoloured dark orange (`markSmfretSoiPairedKeys()`, shared
by this button and the live re-pair below so both colour the overlay
identically) — the matching donor (DD) site is left in
its usual colour, since orange marks "this is the acceptor half of a
confirmed pair," not "this site paired at all." Every site stays visible
regardless, so it's easy to see how many (and which) actually paired,
rather than the unpaired majority disappearing. This method's own pairs
always draw orange, never the gold "via channel matching" uses for an
AA-sourced match (below) — every acceptor position here comes from the
SAME donor-excitation composite that's on screen, so there's no
cross-image ambiguity to flag. Once it succeeds, **Get
time traces** above
automatically reads the resulting paired positions and splits DD into
DD/DA, exactly as if **Pair & plot sSMLM** had been clicked in the other
module.

**Position donor** (`smfretDonorAngle`, shown once ALEX is checked)
answers what the doubled-bearing pairing data can't answer on its own:
which of the two candidate bearings — always exactly 180° apart — actually
points from donor toward acceptor (role assignment in `pairCore()` is
directional, see **Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)** above; nothing in the geometry
alone can tell which direction is physically "toward the acceptor").
Greyed out until a real angle fit has actually run at least once (from
**Preview pairs** or **Pair DD + DA**) — its two options are frozen at
that fit (`refreshSmfretDonorAngleOptions()`) and stay fixed while
toggling between them, so picking one never shifts to a moving target.
Picking an option sets **Pairing (sSMLM & FRET)**'s own **Primary angle**
directly and re-pairs live — there's no automatic way to tell which of the
two is physically correct, so this still needs checking against a known
FRET pair or the optical setup's own geometry (e.g. by comparing the
resulting AA signal in Get FRET data between the two options).

**Simplified, v0.12.1-dev** ("let's simplify... Drop 'Link DD/DA/AA'
entirely... DA is the leading position for time traces to obtain time
traces in the AA channel. drop for now all other options.") — an earlier
round's independent-AA-confirmation step (**Link DD/DA/AA**, plus the
**Filter SOIs** setting that gated it) is gone: Get FRET data now always
samples AA at the DA-established acceptor position directly once paired,
with no separate verification pass and no unpaired-own-position guess. A
future, more general re-introduction of independent AA confirmation is a
plausible follow-up, not attempted this round.

Genuinely still open (see `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md` for the full sketch): the
FULL accurate-FRET correction step on top of the raw E/S values already
computed and exported (leakage/crosstalk, direct excitation, γ-factor —
raw, uncorrected E/S are already shown in the **E(S) histogram** and saved
by **Save FRET data**, this is only the correction layer on top);
per-localization ALEX frame-role tagging on a GENERAL, non-smFRET-SOI
localization set (today's DD/DA/AA splitting only applies to `smfretSOI`
sites via **Get FRET data**); a genuine period/pattern control for
>2-frame ALEX cycles (today's is a fixed 1st-frame + period-2 alternation
only); a "Donor vs acceptor" control exposing `pairCore()`'s own
directional 0th/1st-order role classification under smFRET's own
donor/acceptor terminology for the **Via distances and angles** pairing
method (**Via channel matching** already has its own separate **Position
donor?** disambiguation); and a headless/NDJSON equivalent for **Get FRET
data** itself (`config.smfretLocateSOI` alone doesn't cover it).
The core donor/acceptor pairing pipeline described above, by contrast, is
no longer a mechanical-only proof of concept — it has been run and
verified end to end against real prism/polychroic and dual-view ALEX
acquisition data throughout its development.

### Single-particle tracking (`spt`) {#spt}

Links per-frame
localizations into trajectories and computes a per-track diffusion
coefficient. A trackpy-**inspired** variant (same `search_range`/`memory`
terminology and linking philosophy as the Python `trackpy` package), not a
literal port of its source — there's no way to call real Python trackpy
from a static HTML page. Ported from the user's own `sptPALM-Python`
pipeline (L. lactis sptPALM, Martens et al., *Nat. Commun.* 10, 3552,
2019): `tracking_sptPALM.py`'s `tp.link_df(search_range=…, memory=…)`
call, and `diff_coeffs_from_tracks_fast.py`'s `diff_coeffs_per_track()`
for D. Each frame's track↔candidate bipartite graph (edges within
**SPT search range**, gated by **SPT memory** for gap-bridging) is split
into small connected clusters ("subnetworks" — trackpy's own term) and
each solved via the Hungarian/Kuhn–Munkres algorithm for the
minimum-total-squared-displacement assignment, which keeps crossing
trajectories from swapping identity in the common case — NOT trackpy's
own recursive exact-subnetwork solver for arbitrarily large ambiguous
clusters; a pathologically dense frame falls back to a faster
nearest-neighbor assignment instead (logged once), a real, documented
scope limit real single-molecule SPT data isn't expected to hit. Every
localization gets a `track_id` (even length-1 tracks); track-length
filtering happens only at the diffusion-coefficient step. **Track** is
idempotent and safe to re-run any time — it only sets/overwrites
`track_id`/`D_coeff`, never drops or replaces rows, so there's no
original-vs-tracked state to manage the way sSMLM's Pair/Unpair needs.
One D (µm²/s) is computed per track with at least **SPT min track
length** localizations, from the gap-corrected mean of ALL of that
track's own single-frame squared displacements — an average, not a
linear MSD-vs-lag-time fit, matching the reference pipeline's own
`diff_coeffs_per_track()` exactly — corrected for **SPT localization
error**: D = MSD/(4·frame time) − error²/frame time. Unlike the reference
pipeline there is no max-track-length truncation: an earlier webSMLM
version capped each track's MSD to its first N localizations for equal
per-track weighting in a length-resolved histogram, but that view isn't
built (yet), so every qualifying track's MSD now uses all of its own
steps. A near-immobile or very-short track can compute a non-positive D
(a real artifact of the localization-error correction, not a bug) —
**Track** excludes these from the plotted histogram (logging the excluded
count) rather than clamping them into one bin, which would pool unrelated
tracks into a fake spike. **Track** immediately plots a histogram of D
(log<sub>10</sub>-binned — D commonly spans orders of magnitude between
bound/slow and free/fast populations, matching the reference pipeline's
own logarithmic default) in the raw panel, reusing the table module's own
`computeHist()`/`drawHistogram()`; **Show histograms** redraws it later
without re-tracking (merges what used to be two separate buttons — see the
paragraph after the next one for the toggle that replaced the second one).
**D plot min/max** (µm²/s, defaults 0.004–10 from the
reference pipeline's own histogram range) constrain the D histogram's
own display window only — tracks outside it are excluded from the plot
the same way non-positive D is, but the logged mean/median D always cover
every qualifying track. Editing **Frame time** (the pinned sidebar field
next to **Pixel size (nm)**, not inside this section — see [§1](#sidebar-pxnm-frametime))
or **Localization error** after **Track** has run rescales every already-computed D (D is exactly
linear in 1/frame time once the underlying per-track MSD is fixed) —
including the D shown in the table/CSV and the D histogram if it's
currently open — without needing to click **Track** again; only
**Search range**/**Memory**/**Min track length** actually change which
tracks or steps exist, so only those still require a fresh **Track**.
A toggle button next to the raw panel's own title — labelled **Diffusion**
or **Track length** (whichever the click would switch TO) — swaps between
the D histogram above and the track-length one: it plots the distribution
of every linked track's length (regardless of whether it met **SPT min
track length**) with a log-scaled count axis — track counts fall off
steeply with length, so a linear axis would flatten the useful range into
a sliver — overlaid with an exponential decay fit (a photobleaching-limited
survival model, count ~ e<sup>−L/τ</sup>) whose lifetime τ is logged and
shown on the plot in both localizations and seconds (via **Frame time** —
an approximation once **Memory** &gt; 0, since a bridged gap still counts
as one "loc" of length despite spanning more than one frame). **Show
histograms** opens on the D view by default; if a fresh **Track** run has
no track meeting **Min track length** for a D estimate, it opens on the
track-length view instead. A vertical marker shows the
CURRENT **Min track length** threshold and moves live as that field is
edited, without needing a fresh **Track** click — the underlying bars don't
move (every linked track is plotted regardless of whether it qualifies),
only the marker does. Use this histogram to judge whether **SPT min track
length** is set sensibly for a given dataset.
`track_id`/`D_coeff` become independent,
optional table/CSV columns (§5/§6) the same way sSMLM's `dist`/`sigma1st`
do, so the existing filter grammar works on tracking data for free.
Headless exposure ([§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s
`config.sptTrack`, shipped alongside the rest of v0.11.2) runs **Track**
after drift/NeNA/FRC, not before, since a per-track D benefits from
drift-corrected coordinates and tracking never drops rows the way
sSMLM's pairing does. **Show tracks** (v0.11.7) plots a subset of tracks
directly on the **SMLM reconstruction** — a thin polyline per track, a small
filled circle marking its own start point (diameter = 2× the line
thickness, same colour as the line), and its `track_id` in white on a
semi-transparent backing box for legibility, growing larger the further you
zoom in. Magenta by default. Click a track (anywhere along its own line) to
select it — it highlights magenta in colour-by-D mode, or the same green
the raw panel's own ROI boxes use otherwise. Only tracks meeting **Min
track length** are eligible (blocking the shortest tracks relieves most of
the plotting burden on a dense dataset on its own); **Show tracks (%)**
(default 10%) then samples a further, fixed percentage of the remainder —
deterministically, via a fixed-seed PRNG draw per `track_id` (not derived
from the data), so the same dataset always shows the same track
identities at a given percentage: raising the percentage only reveals
MORE tracks rather than reshuffling which ones were already shown, and
raising **Min track length** only ever removes tracks. Line
thickness tracks the reconstruction's own effective resolution rather
than a fixed screen size — one reconstruction pixel's on-screen width at
the current zoom (`"Pixel size (nm)"/"Magnification"` nm, physically),
so tracks read thin zoomed out and more visible zoomed in, capped at 6px
(with smooth rounded turns) so zooming in a long way to inspect one
track doesn't grow it into an oversized,
spiky shape. **Colour tracks by mean D** (checked by default)
switches each track's colour to the same ramp as the **Fire (hot)**
render LUT instead, normalised against **D plot min/max** (reusing the
D-histogram's own display-range fields rather than a second min/max
pair) — a track with no qualifying D estimate draws a neutral grey, and
a colour-scale legend (centred along the panel's right edge) appears while
it's checked. Turning the overlay on also
switches the reconstruction's own colour map to **Grey**, so the tracks'
own colouring isn't visually competing with a coloured density map — the
same convention the reference pipeline's own track-visualisation figure
uses (plain grayscale background, coloured tracks on top). A toggle next
to the **SMLM reconstruction** title (**Show tracks**/**Hide
tracks**) switches the overlay on/off without re-plotting; ported from
the visual design (not the code — this is a from-scratch canvas overlay,
not a matplotlib port) of the user's own `sptPALM-Python` pipeline's
`plot_single_cell_analysis_sptPALM.py` (`plot_tracks_in_cells()`, which
colours tracks by D via matplotlib's `hot` colormap the same way) and
`plot_cells_locs_sptPALM.py` (magenta for in-track localizations).
**Show track data** (v0.11.7) opens a sortable, filterable table of the
per-track summary — see below for the filter grammar. No
length-RESOLVED D histogram (D binned by track length — distinct from the
plain track-length histogram above) yet — see `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

**Segmentation image** (`applySegmentation`, default unchecked) is
cell-segmentation-aware tracking: checking it reveals **Load segm. image**
(loads a separate integer-labelled mask — 0 = background, 1/2/3/… = cell
number — through the same file types **Load movie** accepts, shown in the
raw panel recoloured so adjacent cells are visually distinct) and **Show
image** (re-shows the already-loaded mask without reloading the
file; opens on the segmentation image by default, with a toggle next to the
raw panel's own title — labelled **Area histogram** — to switch to a
histogram of cell areas, px, and back). `segmentedImageData` (one row per
cell: id, centre of mass in px, area in px) drives that area histogram and
**Min./Max. cell area (px)** (default 50/∞), which gate which cells'
localizations actually get tracked — a fresh **Load segm. image** sets
**Max. cell area** to the largest cell actually found in that image (a
sensible starting upper bound instead of an abstract "no limit"); re-showing
an already-loaded image does not touch it, so it won't silently overwrite a
value you've since adjusted by hand. Headless exposure ([§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s
`config.segmentationFile`, v0.11.6) mirrors this: its mere presence switches
`config.sptTrack` to cell-by-cell tracking, same `segAreaMin`/`segAreaMax`
gating either way.

Once a segmentation image is loaded, **SMLM reconstruction**'s own panel
title gains a **Show segm.** button — swaps the panel from the usual density
reconstruction to the segmented cells (opaque, same colours as the raw-panel
view) with the SAME reconstruction drawn on top, its own black background
made highly transparent, so you can visually confirm localizations line up
with the cells before running **Track** on them (click again — now labelled
**Show recon.** — to go back). Drawn top-left aligned against the
reconstruction regardless of whether the segmentation image's own pixel
dimensions exactly match the loaded movie's — same "warn, don't block"
convention as the load-time size-mismatch warning (a genuine mismatch just
loses a thin strip at the far edge).

Localization positions never depend on Pixel size (nm) — only the scale bar
and nm readouts do (and those already update live, same as the ordinary
reconstruction). If you correct Pixel size (nm) *after* loading the
segmentation image — e.g. dialling it in until the segmented cell outlines
visually match the reconstruction's own shapes — the segmentation's on-screen
size rescales accordingly relative to the (unmoving) localizations, using the
Pixel size (nm) value at the moment the segmentation image was loaded as its
own reference: correcting it upward grows the segmentation's apparent
coverage relative to the localizations, correcting it downward shrinks it.
This reference is captured only on a genuine **Load segm. image**, not on
**Show image** re-displaying the same already-loaded image.

The reconstruction shown in this mode also floors the alpha of any pixel
with real signal, however faint — a sparse, isolated localization is only
barely non-black to begin with (every colour map starts near-black by
design), so without a floor it could end up both dim-coloured and nearly
transparent at once and effectively disappear against a bright cell colour.

With segmentation applied, **Track** (`sptCore()`'s `segCtx` path,
`linkTracksPerCell()`) links each qualifying cell's own localizations
SEPARATELY — a track can never cross a cell boundary — rather than one
whole-field-of-view `linkTracks()` pass, matching the user's own
`sptPALM-Python` pipeline's `apply_cell_segmentation_sptPALM.py`/
`tracking_sptPALM.py` (`use_segmentations` branch): a loc's `cell_id` is
its FILTERED cell membership (`-1` — matching that pipeline's own
sentinel, not `0` — for background or a cell outside the area range, never
tracked), and, only once segmentation is applied, `cell_area [px]` sits
alongside it as an optional CSV/table column, the same pattern
`track_id`/`D_coeff` already use. Each cell's own local track numbering is
offset so `track_id` stays globally unique across the whole result.

### Pipeline (`pipeline`) {#pipeline}

Top-level orchestration wiring the UI buttons to the
modules; `run()` is the Localize entry point.

### View data/filtering (`table`) {#table}

The sortable, cumulatively-filterable localizations table
("View data/filtering") and per-column histograms, see
[§5](#5-table--filter-grammar). `getBaseLocs()` is the single place that
decides whether the table's base row set is raw `lastResult.locs` or
`clusterEvents()`-derived merged events; everything downstream (render,
export, NeNA, FRC) is unaware of the distinction.

**Available during Live streaming** (enabled as soon as any localization
has arrived, same condition as **Correct drift**/NeNA/FRC — reported that
it stayed disabled for the whole session even though locs were visibly
rendering). Sorting, browsing and per-column histograms all work on
whatever has accumulated so far, since they read `_tableData`/
`_tableFiltered` directly and need no filter to work at all. *Committing a
new filter* (typing an expression and pressing Enter, or the reconstruction
panel's own crop tool — see `cropBtn`, [§2](#render)) is refused with a
logged message while a session is active: a committed filter restricts
`renderLocs` to a one-time snapshot that is never re-applied as later
chunks arrive, which would otherwise silently freeze the visible
reconstruction while the real, growing dataset kept moving underneath it.
**Reset** (typing `reset`) always stays available, since clearing is never
harmful. Stop the session first to filter/crop normally.

## 3 · Parameters (`PARAMS` registry)

Single source of truth for every analysis/render/export tunable —
`webSMLM.html`'s `params` module (`const PARAMS = {...}`, search for it
directly; this table mirrors it). `id: null` means no page control yet — only
settable via a loaded settings JSON (`paramOverrides`), the same mechanism
the headless config (`window.webSMLM.analyze(config)`, see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)) also uses. Deliberately excluded from this
registry: pure CSS/layout, and per-dataset working state that resets from the
loaded stack rather than being a reusable default (`calFirst`, `calLast`,
`zmin`, `zmax`).

### Memory & streaming (`in/out`) {#in-out-params}

*Module:* **in/out** — see [§2](#in-out); live streaming's own `window.webSMLM.liveStream` API
(see [§8](#live-streaming) for the full reference) is combined into this one sidebar section too,
since **Enable live streaming** sits directly below the memory-budget controls that also govern
its own raw-frame history cache.

| id | Label | Type | Min | Max | Step | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `memBudgetGB` | Total memory budget (GB) | number | 0.1 | none | 0.5 | ∞ on desktop/laptop, **0.5** on a memory-constrained device |
| `memgb` | Budget raw movies (GB) | number | 0 | 64 | 0.5 | 3 on desktop/laptop, **0** on a memory-constrained device |
| `chunkmb` | Stream heap chunk (MB) | number | 50 | 2000 | 50 | 500 on desktop/laptop, **250** on a memory-constrained device |

Two genuinely separate settings (an earlier version used one shared `memgb` field for both):

- **Total memory budget (GB)** (`memBudgetGB`) is an overall safety ceiling.
  `checkLocsMemory()` (a growing Localize run), `checkRenderSize()` (the reconstruction buffers), and
  `checkTableSize()` (the locs table) all compare their own real, combined memory estimates against
  it — with no budget set (blank/∞, the desktop default), none of them warn or auto-stop at all.
- **Budget raw movies (GB)** (`memgb`) is unrelated to the ceiling above — it only ever governs
  whether a loaded movie is decoded and cached whole in RAM (fast re-runs) or streamed frame-by-
  frame from disk instead (bounded memory, slower re-runs), via `readBudget()`.

**A memory-constrained device (a phone/tablet — `Math.min(innerWidth,innerHeight)<=860`, orientation-
independent) gets a stricter starting profile for all three fields, not the desktop values above** —
real-world mobile crash reports showed that an opt-in-only ceiling protects nobody who never thinks
to set it, and a phone genuinely doesn't have the headroom a desktop does regardless of how good the
memory accounting is:

- **Total memory budget** defaults to **0.5 GB** (a real, enforced ceiling from the very first load,
  not something a mobile user has to already know to turn on — lowered from an initial 1 GB after
  real-world reports of crashes even at that value).
- **Budget raw movies** defaults to **0 GB** — `readBudget()`'s own effective threshold then floors
  at 0, so **every** movie load on a memory-constrained device takes the streamed, chunk-at-a-time
  path (never the whole-file-cached one), regardless of file size.
- **Stream heap** defaults to **250 MB** — a smaller working set per streamed chunk, since streaming
  is now the *only* path on these devices, not an occasional fallback for an unusually large file.

Only the INITIAL default changes (a later resize/rotation doesn't re-trigger it); a loaded settings
JSON's own value for any of these three fields always overrides its default, mobile or not.

**Even with this profile applied, no client-side JS can fully guarantee no OOM tab-kill** on a
sufficiently large/dense movie — mobile browsers give a page no way to detect memory pressure in
advance, and simply reload it blank with no JS-visible error at all. **Loading a movie on a
memory-constrained device shows a one-time pop-up** (`maybeShowMemWarning()`, at most once per page
load — a crash reloads the page anyway, which naturally re-arms it) restating the three settings
above with their current live values, and pointing at what to try next if analysis keeps failing:
lower **Total memory budget** further, narrow the analysed frame range (**First frame**/**Last
frame**), lower **Magnification**, or use a smaller/cropped file. A button on the pop-up itself
(**Open Memory & streaming**) scrolls to and expands that sidebar section directly.

**Enable live streaming** (`liveStreamEnabled`, a plain UI-reveal checkbox, not a `PARAMS` entry —
same "pure display/layout" carve-out as UI theme/sidebar collapse state) shows/hides **WebSocket
URL** and the **Connect**/**Clear** buttons below it, unchecked by default so this rarely-used,
still-**experimental** path stays out of the way until opted into. Live streaming itself has no
`PARAMS` entries of its own beyond this — the render cadence reuses `srPreviewMs`/`srPreviewMaxMs`
([§3](#pipeline-tuning-params)'s "reconstruction live-preview interval", the same adaptive interval
`runCore()`'s own live preview uses), rather than a separate manual "Render every N frames" setting
an earlier version had. That setting's behaviour depended on external chunk granularity a bridge
controls, not this app — the same N meant completely different things depending on whether a
bridge pushed one frame per chunk or a hundred — so it was removed once cadence tracked actual
elapsed time instead.

**In-app "more info…" popup** (`hint-memory` in `webSMLM.html`; synced by
`tools/sync_hints.mjs` — edit here, then run the script, never edit the
`.hint` div directly):

<!-- HINT:memory -->
<ul>
  <li><b>Total memory budget</b> — an overall safety ceiling, blank (∞) by default on desktop/laptop. With no number set, nothing here warns or auto-stops on memory use. On a phone/tablet-class device this defaults to <b>0.5 GB</b> instead — a real, enforced ceiling from the first load, not something you have to already know to turn on. The existing graceful warn/stop behaviour (a growing Localize run, the reconstruction buffers, the locs table) compares its own real, combined memory estimate against whatever value is set here.</li>
  <li><b>Budget raw movies</b> — a separate setting: if the decoded stack fits within it, keep it all in RAM; re-runs then skip decoding entirely. Beyond it, frames are decoded as the analysis reaches them and discarded (“streaming”), so memory stays bounded but re-runs re-decode. Unrelated to the Total memory budget above. Defaults to 3 GB on desktop/laptop, but <b>0 GB</b> on a phone/tablet-class device — meaning every movie load there streams frame-by-frame, never caching a whole file in memory.</li>
  <li><b>Heap</b> — chunk size for streaming, used only when every frame must go through the TIFF decoder (contiguous ImageJ stacks decode one frame at a time and ignore this). Defaults to 500 MB, or 250 MB on a phone/tablet-class device, since streaming is the only load path there.</li>
  <li>Loading a movie on a phone/tablet-class device also shows a one-time pop-up (once per page load) restating these three settings and suggesting what to try next if analysis keeps crashing.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Live streaming (below) is new and still <b>experimental</b> — real and used, but younger and less battle-tested than the rest of the app.</i></p>
<p><b>Enable live streaming</b> reveals <b>WebSocket URL</b> and the <b>Connect</b>/<b>Clear</b> buttons — hidden otherwise, since this path is rarely used compared to a normal file load. Lets an external process push frame chunks into webSMLM as they're acquired, localized and rendered here live, without a full stack ever being loaded upfront. Two ways in:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WebSocket</b> (for hooking into a tab you already have open, in any browser) — a local process you run (e.g. <code>tools/test_livestream_demo.py</code>) opens a WebSocket <i>server</i>; this page only ever <i>connects out</i> to it as a client, opt-in, when you click <b>Connect</b> — webSMLM never listens for incoming connections itself. <b>Connect</b> arms the session using whatever pxnm/gain/method/etc. the sidebar is currently set to at that moment. The connection dropping unexpectedly also ends the session, without closing this tab. Each binary WebSocket message is treated as one chunk's raw TIFF bytes; a text message <code>{"cmd":"stop"}</code> also finalizes the session, leaving the connection itself open.</li>
<li><b>tools/webSMLM-livestream-bridge.mjs</b> (for a fully automated/headless session, e.g. a Gladoscopy RT node) — a Playwright-driven bridge that launches and owns its own browser window, feeding chunks in via <code>window.webSMLM.liveStream.pushChunk()</code>. This path never touches Connect either — the session arms itself automatically on the very first pushed chunk, using whatever pxnm/gain/method/etc. the sidebar is set to at that moment, and <code>window.webSMLM.liveStream.end()</code> ends it — <b>Enable live streaming</b> doesn't need to be checked for this path at all, since it never reaches for the Connect button this checkbox reveals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The top-level <b>Stop</b> button (used to interrupt a Localize/drift/calibration run) is the one control that ends an active streaming session from either path — closing the WebSocket first if one is open — so there's one consistent way to end a session regardless of how it was started, including the bridge path, which has no Connect of its own to click. (An earlier version of this sidebar had a separate Disconnect button; folded into Stop and removed, since Stop does everything it did and also covers the bridge path.)</p>
<p>Each chunk is localized independently (no cross-chunk context) and appended to a running total, so temporal median filtering (FTM) — which needs surrounding frames a chunk doesn't have — is not available in streaming mode; routine per-chunk log lines are also suppressed (only genuine warnings still reach the log) so a fast, small-chunk session — down to one frame per chunk — doesn't flood it, replaced by a single compact "N frames received since streaming start" milestone line each time the reconstruction repaints. That repaint (and milestone line) is throttled adaptively by elapsed time, not a frame count — frequent while cheap, self-throttling once the growing dataset makes a render expensive — the same mechanism a normal Localize run's own live preview uses.</p>
<p>The <b>Raw frame</b> panel gets its own Frame scrubber during streaming, just like a loaded movie — it auto-follows the newest incoming frame by default; dragging it back inspects history (any accepted localizations for that frame still overlay, from the running total) and stops auto-following until you drag it back to the newest frame. Unlike a loaded file, raw pixel data can't all stay in memory forever for an open-ended acquisition — only the most recent frames are kept, sized from <b>Budget raw movies (GB)</b> (this same section) the same way a loaded stack's own frame cache is; scrubbing further back than that shows a note instead of a frame, though every accepted localization from the whole acquisition remains in the reconstruction regardless of whether its raw frame is still retained.</p>
<p><b>Clear localizations</b> discards every localization/frame accumulated so far — the reconstruction, the raw-frame scrub history, the table/CSV export state — and restarts the reconstruction from empty, WITHOUT stopping the session or closing the connection: new chunks keep arriving and accumulating (from frame 1 again) right through the click. Use it to throw away a bad start (focus drift, wrong sample, a settings mistake) partway through an open-ended acquisition without having to reconnect. It's also available once a session has ended, to clear a finished run's leftovers before a fresh <b>Connect</b>/first pushed chunk.</p>
<p><b>Correct drift</b>/<b>NeNA</b>/<b>FRC</b> become available as soon as any localizations have been accumulated, and can be run at any point — including while the session is still active — the same as after a normal Localize. Re-running <b>Correct drift</b> mid-stream always re-estimates from scratch across everything accumulated so far, so it stays safe to re-run as more chunks arrive, but localizations that arrive <i>after</i> a click won't retroactively pick up that correction until it's run again. Temporal median filtering (FTM), by contrast, genuinely isn't available in streaming mode (no cross-chunk context, see above) — for that, run a full accurate Localize on the complete saved acquisition file afterwards (e.g. via <code>tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs</code>).</p>

The sidebar's Simulation settings panel splits these into 5 groups — a flat
**User parameters** group plus 4 collapsible sub-groups (**Simulation type**,
**Fluorophore parameters**, **Camera parameters**, **PSF parameters**) — each
with its own "more info…" popup, plus one final, coarse overview popup for
the section as a whole. **Structure type** (inside **Simulation type**) picks
which synthetic ground-truth structure "Simulate movie" builds — the original
**Filaments + ring** layout (default, unchanged), or **Nuclear pore complex
(NPC)**, which reveals its own cluster of NUP-specific rows/popup within the
same sub-group (see below). After a successful "Simulate movie", a **View GT
localizations** button (next to "Simulate movie" itself) renders the true
simulated emitter positions — one point per simulated blink — into the
reconstruction panel the same way a real reconstruction is drawn, for
comparing what "Localize" actually recovers against the known ground truth.

**In-app "more info…" popups** (synced by `tools/sync_hints.mjs` — edit here,
then run the script, never edit a `.hint` div directly):

**User parameters** (`hint-simulation-user`):

<!-- HINT:simulation-user -->
<p><b>Frames</b> is the length of the simulated movie; <b>FOV (pixels)</b> is the simulated camera's
square field of view; <b>Pixel size (nm)</b> is this simulated stack's own camera pixel size —
independent of any pixel size later used for localization/rendering.
<b>Emitter density</b> is a physical areal density — the average number of ON emitters per µm² in any
given frame — independent of how densely the ground-truth structure is sampled. <b>Labeling
efficiency (%)</b> randomly drops that fraction of physical structure sites from ever carrying a
label at all, before any emitter dynamics run — an unlabeled site never lights up, at any frame,
modelling real labeling chemistry (antibodies, SNAP/Halo, FP fusions) never reaching 100% of its
target. Emitters arrive as a Poisson process at randomly chosen (labeled) structure sites (see
<b>Simulation type</b> below for the structure's own 2D/3D shape). <b>Background</b> (photons/px,
Poisson like the signal) is added at every pixel independently, every frame.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-user -->

**Simulation type** (`hint-simulation-type`):

<!-- HINT:simulation-type -->
<p><b>Structure type</b> picks which synthetic ground-truth structure emitters attach to —
<b>Filaments + ring</b> (default, unchanged) or <b>Nuclear pore complex (NPC)</b> (see that option's
own "more info…" below). <b>3D simulation?</b> makes the generated filament structure oscillate in
z, scaled by <b>Structure Z range (± nm)</b> — unchecked (default), the structure is flat and every
emitter simulates at z=0.</p>
<p><b>Drift (px, total)</b> — total sample drift over all frames, in a random direction (linear from
frame 0). 0 = none. Used to test drift correction — the true drift is stored for scoring.</p>
<p><b>Random seed (0 = random)</b> — 0 (default) keeps the original unseeded behaviour: a fresh
random layout every "Simulate movie" click. Any other value makes every random draw (emitter site
pick, ON/OFF timing, drift direction, and all simulated camera noise) reproducible via a seeded PRNG
instead, so two runs with the same seed and only <b>PSF placement interpolation</b> changed differ
ONLY in the PSF placement itself — useful for A/B-comparing interpolation modes on identical
underlying data.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-type -->

**Nuclear pore complex (NPC) structure** (`hint-simulation-nup`, shown only when **Structure
type** is set to **Nuclear pore complex (NPC)**):

<!-- HINT:simulation-nup -->
<p>Models the endogenously SNAP-tagged Nup96 nuclear pore complex (NPC) reference standard from
Thevathasan <i>et al.</i>, "Nuclear pores as versatile reference standards for quantitative
superresolution microscopy", <i>Nat. Methods</i> 16, 1045–1053 (2019),
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0574-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0574-9</a>
— an 8-fold symmetric ring of 32 Nup96 (8 corners of 4 Nup96 each, arranged in a half-circle arc
of diameter <b>Corner sub-point spread</b>, bulging outward from the ring — see the paper's own
Fig. 1e), <b>NPC ring radius</b> ≈ 53.5 nm, two such rings <b>Axial ring separation</b> ≈ 50 nm apart
along the pore axis (nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic). Geometry is kept fully adjustable rather than
hardcoded, following the parametrized-NPC-simulation approach of Wanninger <i>et al.</i>
("CIR4MICS"), <i>Bioinformatics</i> 39(10), btad587 (2023),
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btad587</a>.
Each of the 64 attachment points is displaced by <b>Linker length, min/max (nm)</b> in a random 3D
direction, modelling the real fluorophore (SNAP/Halo+dye, or antibody) sitting a finite distance
from its Nup96 attachment site rather than exactly on it. <b>Membrane orientation</b> chooses
whether NPCs are viewed <b>Top-down</b> (pore axis along the optical/Z axis, rings face-on — the
common SMLM case) or <b>Sideways</b> (pore axis in-plane along image-Y, rings edge-on, matching
Thevathasan <i>et al.</i>'s own side-view NPC images). <b>Number of NPCs</b>/<b>Min. NPC-NPC
spacing</b> control how many pores are scattered across the simulated field of view and how far
apart; <b>Membrane curvature amplitude</b> adds a gentle bowl-shaped curvature (centred so the
field's mean offset stays ~0) to the membrane patch the NPCs sit on. <b>Debug: view single NUP</b>
is a temporary aid showing one NPC's 64 points (top view and side view) for checking the geometry
directly.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-nup -->

**Fluorophore parameters** (`hint-simulation-fluorophore`):

<!-- HINT:simulation-fluorophore -->
<p>A <b>molecule</b> activates at a random time (drawn from well before frame 0, so the movie
starts in equilibrium rather than with everything switching on at once) and then blinks: an
exponentially-distributed ON period (mean = <b>ON lifetime</b>) ends either in bleaching, with
probability <b>Bleach prob. per blink</b>, or in a dark period (exponential, mean = <b>Dark
lifetime</b>) followed by another blink. At the default bleach probability of 1 every molecule
blinks exactly once — the original model. <b>Photons/emitter/frame</b> is scaled by the fraction of
a frame the emitter was actually on, so a half-frame overlap emits half the photons; <b>Photon rate
spread (CV)</b> makes each blink's rate log-normal around that value (0 = every blink equally
bright). <b>Emitter density</b> keeps meaning the mean number of emitters ON per µm² per frame
whatever the kinetics — molecules simply activate less often when each one blinks more.</p>
<p><b>Illumination profile</b> makes an emitter's brightness depend on where it sits, as a real
beam does: a <b>Gaussian beam</b> or a soft-edged <b>flat-top disc</b> of <b>Beam width</b> percent
of the field of view. The field is an attenuation with peak 1, so Photons/emitter/frame and
Background (photons/px) become the values at the beam <i>centre</i> and nothing is ever brighter
than what you typed; the log reports what the profile costs on average (0.37× for a 60% Gaussian).
The background is attenuated by the same beam, which is why the detector does not simply get
worse: on one scored run the 50%-detection point <i>fell</i> from 440 to 227 photons, because the
background fell with the signal — while recall went 81.6% → 78.2% and the lateral error 5.0 →
9.1 nm, both from the emitters at the edge now being dim.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-fluorophore -->

**Background** (`hint-simulation-background`):

<!-- HINT:simulation-background -->
<p><b>Background (photons/px)</b> above stays the mean over the whole field of view; this
section only reshapes it in space and time. <b>Cell contrast</b> draws a soft-edged cell that many
times brighter inside than outside (autofluorescence). <b>Out-of-focus haze</b> adds the labelled
structure's own projected density, blurred to <b>Haze blur σ</b> — a static stand-in for light from
far above and below the focal plane. <b>Fade time constant</b> lets the background bleach down to a
30% floor over the movie, which is what a temporal-median (FTM) correction exists for.
<b>Out-of-focus emitters</b> goes further: a second, blinking population on the same structure,
0.3–2 µm out of focus (<b>Out-of-focus depth</b>), rendered with the real defocused PSF — so it
needs the Zernike-aberrated PSF model, and it is the one setting here with a real cost, roughly
tripling the simulation time at a ratio of 1. Those emitters are in the movie but never in the
score. A smooth background costs the <i>detector</i> almost nothing — the band-pass removes it before
thresholding — but it costs <i>precision</i>, through the extra shot noise.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-background -->

**Camera parameters** (`hint-simulation-camera`):

<!-- HINT:simulation-camera -->
<p><b>Gain/offset/offset std/read noise</b> forward-model a real sensor: Gaussian read noise (σ in
electrons) is added to the photon count before the gain conversion, then a per-pixel offset map
(Gaussian around the mean offset, fixed for the whole stack) is added — independent of the fit-side
camera gain/offset used for localization. For a clean self-consistency test with the <b>Gain/offset
estimation</b> section's own readout-noise field, combine read noise and offset std in quadrature
(√(read_noise²+offset_std²), offset std converted to photons via this panel's gain) — a static
per-pixel offset pattern looks identical to read noise in a single frame's Fourier content, so
leaving it out biases the fitted offset the same way.</p>
<p><b>Camera type</b> picks the sensor model. <code>sCMOS / CCD</code> is the original path above.
<code>EMCCD</code> sends photoelectrons (<b>Quantum efficiency</b>, plus <b>Clock-induced
charge</b>) through an electron-multiplying register, modelled as a Gamma draw: compounded with the
Poisson draw that gives the pixel variance <i>twice</i> its mean, which is the √2 excess noise a
real EMCCD has. <b>EM gain</b> only decides how far the register pushes read noise below the
signal, and <b>Bit depth</b> rounds ADU to integers and clips at saturation. Measured on a flat
field: variance/mean = 2.00 on EMCCD against 1.08 on sCMOS at the same 100 photons/px. On a
scored run the cost was 1.34× the lateral error (5.69 vs 4.25 nm per axis) — less than the √2 the
excess noise alone would give, because the register also makes read noise negligible: that trade
is the reason EMCCDs exist. When you simulate EMCCD data, set <b>Excess noise F²</b> to 2 in
Localisation settings, or the fit's own uncertainty will claim a precision it does not have.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation-camera -->

**Engineered PSFs and what they buy.** The Zernike basis runs to 28 terms (every mode up to
n = 6; the first 15 are unchanged, so older presets and settings files mean exactly what they
did). Three presets put astigmatism at successive orders (primary, secondary, tertiary) to stretch
the depth over which z is recoverable, and the trade is monotone — measured at 3000 photons,
5 background photons/px, 100 nm pixels:

| preset | z-CRLB at focus | single-valued z range | lateral CRLB at focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| `astigModerate` (for reference) | 10.1 nm | ±500 nm | 2.6 nm |
| `saddlePoint` | 12.6 nm | ±700 nm | 5.8 nm |
| `extendedRange` | 23.6 nm | ±1000 nm | 6.3 nm |
| `extendedRangeStrong` | 23.9 nm | ±1300 nm | 10.3 nm |

They are named for that behaviour and **not** called tetrapods: the published tetrapod and
saddle-point masks come from numerical optimisation over dozens of modes and show a four-lobed
shape these do not reproduce (measured: one lobe at focus, three at ±1.5 µm).

**Double helix** is a real phase mask rather than a Zernike sum — `simulation_psfMaskType`, added
to the pupil on top of whatever Zernike coefficients are set. It is built the way the original is:
a superposition of Gauss-Laguerre modes along the line l = 2p + 1 in the modal plane, of which
only the phase is kept (Pavani & Piestun, *Opt. Express* 16, 3484 (2008)). Those modes share a
Gouy phase that advances linearly with defocus, which is why the two lobes **rotate** with z
instead of blurring: measured 60° over ±800 nm at the default 5 modes and a waist of 1.0 pupil
radii, with the sign of z in the direction of rotation. About 11% of the light sits in the two
lobes, well below a real fabricated mask — the price of a phase-only analytic construction.
A cheaper first attempt (concentric zones of increasing vortex charge) was replaced by this one.
It was reported as "measured and rejected" in build 2026-09-20e, but that measurement ran through
the worker path while the mask was being dropped there, so it measured an unaberrated PSF and
proves nothing about it; the Gauss-Laguerre construction is here because it is the published one.

**Fitting them: `PSF model MLE 3D` (`psfmle`).** A Gaussian has no width to read z from once the
PSF is engineered, so this method fits the modelled PSF itself: the camera-pixel-integrated
kernel, interpolated continuously in x, y and z (tricubic Catmull-Rom over the oversampled
samples), handed to the same Fisher-scoring driver the Gaussian MLEs use. Depth is therefore a
fitted parameter with its own CRLB, not a value inverted from a width calibration afterwards —
and the method needs **no calibration file at all**: its model comes from the Simulation
settings' PSF section, so the optical parameters (and `simulation_pxnm`) must match the data.
A coarse z scan precedes the Newton step, because an engineered PSF's likelihood is not unimodal
in z.

Measured on one astigmatic 3D movie (3000 photons, ±500 nm structure), against `mle3d` on the
same data: axial median **16.9 nm vs 22.6 nm**, equal detection (79.3% vs 79.0%) and equal
lateral accuracy (6.07 vs 6.24 nm), at 1.8× the time — 0.5 ms/spot for the fit itself, measured
directly, against 0.086 ms for the Gaussian elliptical MLE. It runs **single-threaded** for now:
the model is megabytes that would have to reach every worker through a second message type, which
this pool's single `onmessage` makes a real scheduling hazard.

**On the double helix.** This took three wrong turns worth recording, because each looked
convincing. `psfmle` on a DH PSF first returned the *magnitude* of z to a few nm and its *sign*
about half the time. A rescan-and-restart of the z scan changed nothing; lobe pairing in the
detector merged nothing; and feeding the fitter data generated from its own model reproduced the
failure exactly — which seemed to prove the mask, not the fitter, was at fault.

It was none of those. `buildPsfPlanesParallel()` and the PSF worker each spell the optical
parameters out by hand instead of forwarding the config, and **neither listed the mask fields**,
so every kernel built through the worker pool — the default path — came back unaberrated. The
tell was there to be read earlier: six different mask settings all reported the same z-CRLB, and
a kernel built with the mask was byte-identical to one built without it. With the parameters
forwarded, the sign of z is encoded decisively: the expected log-likelihood ratio between +z and
−z at ±400 nm and 5000 photons is **516**, where an unaberrated PSF gives exactly 0, and the
fitter recovers the sign on every test emitter (−598, −384, −224, 189, 405, 595 nm for true
−600 … +600).

On a real DH movie the fit now tracks depth (slope of fitted against true z 0.67, axial median
37 nm), and what limits it is detection rather than fitting: the PSF arrives as several maxima
per emitter, so each molecule is fitted several times and precision falls to 25%. **Merge
detections within (px)** exists for that, and the trade is measured — merging within 6 px:
precision 30%, slope 0.71; within 10 px: precision 47%, slope **1.04**, no gross failures, but
recall down from 49% to 26% as neighbouring emitters start merging too. It defaults to 0 (off),
which is correct for any single-blob PSF.

**The yardstick: `psfZCramerRao()`.** Every PSF build now also reports the Cramér-Rao lower bound
on x, y and z, computed from the kernel itself under the current photon and background settings,
with N and background marginalised as nuisance parameters exactly as a real fit must. It asks only
how much the image changes per nanometre of defocus, so unlike `zUsableNm` — which follows
σ_y/σ_x and is meaningless for a double helix (it reports 0) — it applies to any PSF shape. No
estimator can beat it, so it is what a fitter should be judged against: the astigmatic 3D run
scored an axial median of 23.4 nm against a bound of ~10 nm, i.e. the width-based fit gives away a
factor of 2.4.

**PSF parameters** (`hint-simulation-psf`):

<p><b>PSF model</b> — <code>gaussian</code> (default, unchanged) is the fixed-σ=1.3 isotropic
Gaussian above. <code>zernike</code> reveals a Gibson-Lanni + Zernike-pupil optical model (NA,
wavelength, sample/immersion refractive index, working distance, emitter depth, z range/step,
lateral oversampling, kernel width) and a curated <b>Zernike aberration preset</b> dropdown
(astigmatism/coma/spherical/trefoil/mixed, at a few preset strengths) — magnitudes are
order-of-magnitude estimates, not paper-sourced calibrated values. Selecting <code>zernike</code>
also makes <b>Simulate movie</b> itself splat every emitter from this kernel (2D only — one fixed
<b>Emitter depth into sample</b> for the whole movie), not just the preview below.
<b>PSF placement interpolation</b> (<code>nearest</code>/<code>linear</code>/<code>cubic</code>,

oversampled kernel before it's summed down (photon-count-conserving) to the camera pixel grid — a
higher-quality but more expensive option than the fixed-σ Gaussian path ever needed. A <b>Custom

field accepts 15 comma-separated milliwave coefficients (one per OSA Zernike index 0-14; 1000 =
one full wave) to override the preset entirely. <b>Emitter depth into sample</b> is compensated for
its own depth-induced focal shift (a real Gibson-Lanni effect: imaging deeper into a lower-index

physics on a differently-discretized (Cartesian, not polar) grid and so converges to the same PSF
as its own internal resolution increases rather than matching the direct method bit-for-bit
(residual difference well under 1% at its shipped resolution). <b>Preview PSF</b> builds this
(cached, oversampled) kernel and shows it as a z-scrollable slice in the raw panel — this is a

**Section overview** (`hint-simulation`, the final, coarse popup at the bottom of the whole panel):

<!-- HINT:simulation -->
<p>"Simulate movie" builds a fully synthetic ground-truth stack — random emitter placement along a
simulated structure, physically modelled blinking, shot/read/offset camera noise, and (optionally) a
real vectorial PSF — for validating and teaching the rest of the pipeline against known-correct
answers. Settings above are grouped into <b>User parameters</b> (the everyday knobs), <b>Simulation
type</b> (2D/3D structure, drift, seed), <b>Fluorophore parameters</b> (photon output and blinking
kinetics), <b>Camera parameters</b> (sensor noise model), and <b>PSF parameters</b> (Gaussian vs.
physically modelled optics) — see each group's own "more info…" for detail.</p>
<!-- /HINT:simulation -->

`dens` is a **physical areal density** (ON emitters/µm²/frame), not tied to
how densely the internal ground-truth structure (`buildStructure()`) happens
to sample candidate points. Emitters arrive as a Poisson process over the
whole field of view at randomly chosen structure sites; each turns on
**exactly once** (no repeated blinking) — a fractional start time (drawn
from up to 5×`simlifetime` before frame 0, so the exponential's early tail
can already be mid-event at frame 0) and an exponentially-distributed ON
duration (mean = `simlifetime`). `phot` is per-emitter, per (fully-occupied)
frame — an emitter's actual output in a given frame scales by its overlap
fraction with that frame, so e.g. a half-frame overlap emits half `phot`.
`simbg` is a **per-pixel** rate (every pixel gets `simbg` photons of
background independently, every frame — not a total budget spread across
the frame), Poisson like the signal.

The forward **camera model** — decoupled from the fit-side `gain`/
`camoffset` (the [Export](#export-params) fields), so
simulated ground truth and the fit's assumed camera can be matched (for a
clean self-test) or intentionally mismatched (to test robustness) — applies,
per pixel, in this order: Poisson shot noise on (background + PSF signal) →
Gaussian read noise (`simulation_readnoise`, electrons) added before the
gain conversion → `simulation_gain` converts photons+read-noise to ADU → a
**fixed per-pixel offset map** (`simulation_offset` mean, `simulation_offset_std`
Gaussian spread, generated once per stack and reused every frame — modelling
real sensor fixed-pattern offset noise) is added → clamped ≥ 0.

`simulation_cameraType` = `emccd` replaces the first two steps with an EMCCD sensor:
photons → photoelectrons (`simulation_qe`) plus `simulation_cic` spurious electrons, Poisson →
the electron-multiplying register as a Gamma(shape = electrons, scale = 1) draw → read noise
referred back through the register (`simulation_readnoise`/`simulation_emGain`) → integer ADU,
clipped at 2^`simulation_bitDepth` − 1. Compounding Poisson with Gamma gives a variance of
**twice** the mean — the √2 excess noise factor a real gain register has (Hirsch et al.,
*PLoS ONE* 8(1):e53671, 2013) — measured here as variance/mean = 2.00 against 1.08 on the sCMOS
path at 100 photons/px. Scale 1 rather than a literal EM gain in electrons is a deliberate
normalisation: it keeps `simulation_gain` meaning one thing end to end (photons/ADU) and keeps
ADU comparable between the two sensor types, so `simulation_emGain` matters only where it
physically does at these settings — by how far it pushes read noise below the signal.

On the analysis side, `cameraExcessNoise` (F²) tells the fitter about it: `runCore()` hands the
fitters `gain/F²` and scales the returned photon counts back by F², so positions are unchanged,
photon counts stay in real photons, and the CRLB (`lpx`/`lpy`/`lpz`) widens by exactly √F² —
which is what makes it honest. Measured on one scored run (3000 photons, uniform 3D): the EMCCD
cost 1.34× the lateral error of the sCMOS path (5.69 vs 4.25 nm per axis — less than √2, because
the register also makes read noise negligible), and the CRLB's coverage of that error went from
0.66 at F² = 1 to 0.93 at F² = 2. Leaving F² at 1 on EMCCD data does not change where the
molecules land; it makes the reported precision claim about 30% better than the truth.
`simulation_pxnm` is this panel's own pixel size (kept separate from the
shared `pxnm` render/load control so **Simulation settings** is
self-contained); the shared `pxnm` control is synced to it automatically
after a stack is generated, so the scale bar / a re-run config stay
consistent. Ground-truth emitter events (`x,y,tStart,tEnd,photonsTotal`) are
stored in `groundTruthEvents` for comparison against recovered
localizations. `driftpx` (as before) accumulates linearly over all frames in
a random direction; the true per-frame drift is stored (`simTrueDrift`) for
scoring drift correction. See the **simulation** module.

**Match radius** is how close, laterally, a localization must be to a
ground-truth emitter in the same frame to count as its detection. 250 nm is
a couple of PSF widths: loose enough not to reject genuine but imprecise
localizations, tight enough not to pair unrelated emitters at the densities
the simulator produces. **Score z bins** splits the true-z axis for the
bias/RMS curve — too few hides where accuracy falls off, too many leaves
each bin too sparse to mean anything.

fields (merged in — see that section's own note below, there is no

here, then run the script, never edit the `.hint` div directly):

<!-- HINT:detectfit -->
<ul>
  <li><b>Gain (photons/ADU)</b>/<b>Camera offset (ADU)</b> convert every pixel to true photon units before fitting — with gain 1 the exported “intensity [photon]” is really <b>ADU</b> (analog-to-digital unit, the camera's raw pixel count before any photon conversion), and the uncertainty column (∝ 1/√N) is not physically meaningful. A single scalar gain suits <b>EMCCD</b>; on <b>sCMOS</b> gain, offset and read noise vary per pixel, so a scalar is only an approximation — see <code>docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md</code>. <b>Get estimate</b> fills both fields in from a PCFO estimate (Gain &amp; offset estimation, runs <b>Estimate</b> first if it hasn't been computed yet) — it never runs on its own, so these fields keep whatever you last set until you click it.</li>
  <li><b>Excess noise F²</b> — 1 for sCMOS/CCD, 2 for an EMCCD at high gain, whose gain register makes each pixel's variance F² times its mean. The fit then runs in F²-photon units: positions do not move, photon counts stay in real photons, and the reported precision widens by √F² to match the real spread.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fit method</b> — σ_noise below is the spread of the filtered image, not the PSF width.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Phasor 2D/3D</b> — ~100–250× faster per candidate (265× on the GATTA-PAINT test stack). No per-localization uncertainty; 3D needs a phasor-magnitude calibration.</li>
  <li><b>Gaussian LS 2D</b> — ordinary least-squares; ≈ slightly better precision than phasor, much slower.</li>
  <li><b>Gauss MLE spherical</b> (default) — Poisson-optimal, one symmetric σ, reports a real CRLB uncertainty; cost ≈ LS.</li>
  <li><b>Gauss MLE elliptical</b> / <b>Gauss MLE rotated elliptical</b> — independent σx/σy (axis-aligned, or at a rotation angle) instead of one symmetric σ; see <b>3D localisation</b> below.</li>
  <li><b>PSF model MLE 3D</b> (experimental) — fits the modelled PSF itself (Simulation settings → PSF) instead of a Gaussian, with z a fitted parameter: no calibration file, and it works for PSFs with no meaningful width (double helix, extended depth). Single-threaded and CPU-only for now.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3D localisation</b> (only shown for the two elliptical methods above) — <b>checked</b> (default): a free rotation angle recovered per emitter, plus z from a loaded calibration, same as <b>Gauss MLE elliptical</b>. <b>Unchecked</b>: a calibration-free fit with no z — for <b>Gauss MLE elliptical</b> this is a plain 2D elliptical fit; for the rotated method the angle is instead fixed to the sSMLM pairing step's own dispersion bearing (Pairing (sSMLM &amp; FRET) → Primary angle).</p>
<p><b>Fit radius 2D</b>/<b>Fit radius 3D</b> set the fit window half-width used for a 2D vs. a genuinely 3D fit respectively — whichever one is relevant switches in automatically as you change method/<b>3D localisation</b>, so there's no separate "current Fit radius" field to keep in sync by hand.</p>
<p><b>Detection filter</b> — Wavelet and DoG both band-pass the frame (suppress smooth background, enhance PSF-sized spots); candidates are strict local maxima above <b>k·σ_noise</b>. The three filters respond very differently, so <b>re-tune the threshold</b> when switching between them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wavelet (B-spline)</b> (default) — the à trous cubic-B-spline wavelet used by ThunderSTORM: no σ (scale is fixed by the wavelet levels), roughly 2× faster to filter, and the recommended choice.</li>
  <li><b>DoG band-pass</b> — a difference of Gaussians whose scale is tuned by σ_PSF; its <b>Exact band-pass</b> option replaces the fast box approximation of the background with a true Gaussian (~2× slower, but exactly reproducible — on the GATTA-PAINT test stack it changes 0.38% of detections).</li>
  <li><b>Uniform box filter</b> — a difference of two box (uniform) averages sized off σ_PSF, following Huang, Schwartz, Byars &amp; Lidke (2011); unlike the other two it thresholds on a plain <b>intensity</b> value, not k·σ_noise, so its default (25) needs re-tuning to your camera's counts.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Merge detections (px)</b> — maxima closer together than this are merged into one detection at their centroid. Leave it at 0 (off) for any ordinary PSF; for an engineered PSF that reaches the detector as several maxima per emitter, set roughly its lobe separation.</p>
<p><b>Temporal median filtering</b> (FTM) is a per-pixel background correction — for a given frame, each pixel's value across a <b>window</b> of nearby frames (centred on that frame; clamped, not shrunk, at the very first/last few frames, so every frame still gets a full-width window) has its <b>median</b> subtracted — a robust estimate of that pixel's slowly-varying background at this point in time. Since a blinking emitter occupies far less than half the window at any one pixel, the median tracks the background, not the signal, so what's left after subtraction is mostly signal above background. Checking this box:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adds a <b>raw / FTM-corrected</b> toggle next to the raw panel title, computing the correction live for whichever frame you're scrubbed to.</li>
  <li>Makes <b>Localize itself run on FTM-corrected frames</b> — processed in worker-parallel chunks when a worker pool is available, main-thread otherwise; either way the whole stack is never held twice (raw + corrected) in memory at once.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Values that would go negative after subtraction are floored at the camera offset instead</b> (a background estimate briefly above the true noise floor is expected, not an error) — this keeps the corrected pixel in the same units the fit's own gain/offset conversion expects, so photon counts aren't double-corrected. It's still <i>not</i> quite the same noise distribution the fit functions otherwise assume (Poisson-MLE in particular models a Poisson-distributed background around some positive mean; a hard floor truncates that slightly, which can bias fitted background/photon counts and reported uncertainty low in very dim regions). Choose the <b>window size</b> so the "signal occupies less than half the window" assumption above actually holds for your data (too small and the median starts tracking — and cancelling — real signal); the loaded stack must have at least that many frames.</p>

**Fit radius, and why `winr` itself has no page control.** `winr` is the
value every fitter actually uses; `winr2d`/`winr3d` are the two fields
actually shown in the sidebar, and `applyWinrDefault()` (MODULE: pipeline)
keeps `winr` mirroring whichever one is relevant as the 2D/3D context
changes (`currentIs3d()` — real z coming out, not just a 3D-capable method
selected: `mle3d`/`gaussmleEll` with **3D localisation** unchecked still
counts as 2D here). A symmetric 2D PSF at this codebase's typical σ_PSF
(~1.3 px) is well-fit by a narrower window than an astigmatic 3D PSF, whose
elongated axis needs more pixels not to get truncated/biased near the edges
of the calibrated z-range — one global default couldn't serve both well.
`winr`'s own sidebar row is present in the DOM (`style="display:none"`) but
never shown — kept only so the existing PARAMS/live-preview/worker wiring
built around `$('winr')` needs no changes; edit **Fit radius 2D**/**Fit
radius 3D** directly instead; they now double as "the active value for that
mode", not just a remembered default for a separate visible field (dropped
in v0.12.1-dev once having all three on screen at once — reported — read as
confusingly redundant, since two of the three always showed the identical
number anyway). The auto-apply is still internally **non-clobbering** (only
overwrites `winr` if its current value still equals whatever the mechanism
itself last wrote there, tracked in `_winrAutoSetValue`) — with no UI path
left to manually edit `winr` itself, this now just means editing the
*inactive* one of `winr2d`/`winr3d` has no visible effect until you actually
switch into that context, which is what you'd want. This whole mechanism is
also a real fix for a reported issue: `winr` used to *also* set the
accept/reject drift tolerance every fitter applies (see the next paragraph)
— changing it to get more/less fit context silently changed how strict that
gate was too, with a non-obvious, data-dependent direction. Headless
`analyze()` callers set `winr` directly in `config`, same as always (still
a real, settable field, just without a page control — the same convention
[§3](#fit-params) already uses for parameters with no dedicated control) —
the auto-apply mechanism is interactive-UI-only, with no headless
equivalent (matching every other `updateMethodUI()`-driven auto-default,
e.g. the LUT auto-selection).

**The accept/reject drift gate no longer depends on Fit radius at all.**
Every fitter (`gaussianFit`, `gaussianFitElliptical`, `gaussianMLEspheric`,
`gaussianMLEelliptic`, `gaussianMLEellipticangled`) rejects a converged fit
whose position drifted too far from its seed — previously bounded by `r`
(Fit radius itself), so widening the window to feed a fit more background
context also loosened (or, via harder convergence in a busier/crowded
window, sometimes effectively tightened) how strict that rejection was, a
real reported confusion: the same visual set of spots gave different
accepted counts at Fit radius 3 vs 4, with no reliable direction. The bound
is now `FIT_MAX_DRIFT_SIGMA_MULT` (2) times the *seed* σ_PSF — never the
fit's own output sx/sy, which would be circular — a physically meaningful
"did this converge near where it should" test that's independent of window
size. A shared internal constant, not a live setting, since all 5 fitters
are stringified into the detect/fit worker and a genuinely tunable value
would need threading through that worker's own dispatch protocol; could
become a real `PARAMS` entry later if 2× ever proves wrong for real data.

`fitLastFrame` defaults to `Infinity`, not a finite placeholder: an
`<input type=number>` sanitizes a non-finite value to a blank field, and a
blank field reads back (via `paramValue()`'s `isFinite` fallback) as "the
whole stack" — so if `initScrub()`'s per-load reset were ever skipped, or a
user manually clears the field, the safe fallback is no restriction, never a
silent restriction down to (near-)nothing. Both fields reset to `1`/the
loaded stack's frame count on every new load. Restricting the range means
the skipped frames are never even fetched/decoded, not just excluded from
the result afterward — see the **pipeline** module / `runCore()`.

**`ftmEnabled`/`ftmWindow` — temporal median filtering (FTM)** — see the
popup above for what checking it does (the raw/FTM-corrected toggle,
`rawFtmBtn`, and Localize itself running on corrected frames). Both share
the same underlying correction: for a given frame, each
pixel's value across a `ftmWindow`-frame window of context (centred on that
frame; clamped, not shrunk, at the two ends of the stack, so every frame
still gets a full-width window) has its **median** subtracted, then
**floored at `camoffset`** (not 0) and has `camoffset` added back — see
"gain/camoffset interaction" below for why. Requires the loaded stack to
have at least `ftmWindow` frames — falls back to raw data, with a logged
warning, otherwise. Can be checked at any time — before, during, or after
loading a stack — with no load-time coupling.

An earlier design ran this once over the *whole* stack right after loading
and replaced `stack` itself; it was reverted because it needed the raw and
corrected copies fully materialized in memory at the same time, which
doesn't work for a stack too big to hold both — see
`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`. Both current paths avoid that by never holding
more than a bounded amount of raw/corrected data at once:

- **Scrubbing preview** (`ftmFrame()`/`ftmFrameParallel()`) computes exactly
  one frame at a time, fetching only that frame's own `ftmWindow`-wide
  context. Parallelizes **spatially** across the worker pool (row bands, no
  overlap/border margin needed, since each pixel's computation depends only
  on its own value across the context window, never on neighbouring
  pixels). Measured (500-frame synthetic stacks, window 50, 8 workers): ~23
  ms at 128×128, ~35 ms at 256×256, ~130 ms at 512×512, ~510 ms at
  1024×1024 — fine for occasional scrubbing at smaller frame sizes, but
  noticeably laggy for rapid dragging on large frames. `showFrame()`
  substitutes the corrected frame in place of the raw one (via
  `rawFtmView`, the toggle's on/off state) before running the same
  detect/live-preview logic every other branch already uses — ROI boxes
  and live-fit crosshairs on the corrected preview reflect it too. The raw
  panel **title stays fixed at "Raw frame"** regardless of the toggle
  state — only the button's own label changes; unchecking `ftmEnabled`
  hides the button and resets the toggle back to raw.
- **Localize** processes the stack in **chunks**, sized from the
  `chunkmb` "Stream heap chunk" budget (half of it, since a chunk's raw
  context and corrected output are both resident at once) rather than a
  fixed constant, so chunking scales with frame size and the user's own
  memory tuning. Two implementations share the same per-pixel sliding-
  window median algorithm (`ftmSeriesGlobal` — O(window) per step, not a
  full resort), chosen by whether `runCore()` is using the worker pool at
  all for this Run:
  - **No worker pool** (`makeFtmStack()`): wraps the stack so its existing
    serial frame-fetch calls transparently receive FTM-corrected data,
    chunked and cached so a run of nearby requests is served from one
    chunk computation instead of redundantly re-fetching/re-sorting
    nearly the same context each time. Runs on the main thread — nothing
    else is contending for it in this path.
  - **Worker pool in use**: a dedicated **barrier-phased loop** inside
    `runCore()`, alternating a full-pool-parallel **FTM-correction phase**
    (`ftmChunkParallel()`, row-band split, same reasoning as the scrubbing
    preview) with a full-pool-parallel **detect/fit phase** (the same
    frame-batch dispatch the non-FTM path uses) for each chunk in turn,
    with a hard barrier between the two phases on every chunk — the pool
    is never asked to do both jobs at once. This matters because each
    worker has exactly **one** `onmessage` slot, not a job queue: without
    the barrier, an FTM-correction reply and a detect/fit reply could
    clobber each other's handler mid-flight. An earlier version ran chunk
    correction unconditionally on the main thread (to sidestep that
    conflict without a barrier) — measured as the dominant cost on a fast
    fitter with large frames (~7.5 s FTM vs. ~5.4 s total detect/fit CPU
    on a 256×256×1200 case, 8% worker utilisation). The barrier-phased
    design gets full parallelism for both phases instead, at the cost of
    losing the small pipelining overlap ("fetch/correct the next chunk"
    while "fitting the previous one") the non-FTM continuous-dispatch
    loop gets for free — benchmark-confirmed small next to what
    parallelizing the FTM phase itself buys back.

  Both implementations need to fetch a *little* more context than
  `±ftmWindow/2` around a chunk's core frames whenever that chunk's core
  range comes close enough to either end of the **whole stack** (not the
  Run's own `fitFirstFrame`/`fitLastFrame` range) that a frame's own
  window would otherwise be clamped further than the chunk's own edge
  padding accounts for — the same per-frame clamp `ftmSeriesGlobal`
  applies internally, just computed once for the chunk's own worst-case
  frame instead of the chunk's own start/end. Getting this wrong doesn't
  crash or obviously misbehave — it silently starves the last few frames
  of a stack of part of their correct background window, biasing their
  photon counts by a few percent — so a barrier-phased-worker-vs-serial
  A/B correctness check (not eyeballing loc counts, which stayed close)
  is what caught it.

  **Memory**: `chunkmb`'s `/2` split assumes only a chunk's raw context and
  corrected output need to coexist — true for the FTM-correction phase
  itself, but the barrier-phased worker loop used to keep the (by then dead)
  context array reachable through the *following* detect/fit dispatch phase
  too (same `while`-loop iteration/closure), which has its own separate
  memory cost (structured-clone `postMessage` per batch) — so real peak
  memory could run over the intended `chunkmb` budget for the back half of
  every chunk. Root cause of a real mobile OOM at `chunkmb=1000` (§3's
  default moved back to 500 after this was found); fixed by dropping the
  context reference the moment the corrected output is in hand, before the
  detect/fit phase's own allocations start. `runCore()` also logs an
  estimated peak-memory figure right after the chunk-size line (`~chunkmb`
  MB for FTM's own working set, plus the already-decoded stack's size if
  `memgb` let the whole thing cache in RAM — a **separate** budget that
  adds on top of `chunkmb`, not a shared ceiling with it) with an advisory
  above ~800 MB combined — gated on `memBudgetGB` (the opt-in Total memory
  budget) staying at/below 8 GB, OR still at its own unset default (nobody's
  told us they have headroom yet), so a desktop user who's deliberately
  raised it past 8 GB isn't nagged every Run once they've already said they
  have headroom.
  This is visibility only, not prevention: a mobile tab killed for memory
  pressure gets **no** JS-visible error at all (no exception, no `onerror`,
  the page just reloads blank) — there is no reliable way to detect or head
  off an OOM kill from inside the page, only to avoid approaching the
  ceiling in the first place and explain what happened when a Run
  mysteriously stops with no further log line.

Runs on raw ADU data in both paths, before gain/camoffset conversion
inside the fit functions. Those functions convert every pixel via
`(raw−camoffset)×gain`; since FTM-corrected pixels are *already*
background-subtracted, floor-at-0 would let that conversion subtract
`camoffset` a **second** time, systematically undercounting photons by
`camoffset×gain`. Flooring/re-adding `camoffset` instead (see above)
makes the fit's own `−camoffset` cancel back out, leaving just `×gain` on
the true signal-above-background — floored at 0 in photon space, same as
intended. The floor is still not quite the same noise distribution the
Poisson-MLE fitters otherwise assume (which models a Poisson-distributed
background around some *positive* mean), which can bias fitted
background/photon counts and reported uncertainty low in very dim
regions.

**Log output**: when FTM is active, a Run's log gains a
`Temporal median filtering ON (window=N) — Localize runs on FTM-corrected
frames.` line up front, and the timing breakdown gains an `FTM filter` line
— wall time spent computing chunks, not time spent waiting on another
already-in-flight chunk (serial path) or on the barrier-phased pool
(worker path) — alongside `frame access`/`detect`/`fit`, also returned as
`timings.ftmMs` from `runCore()`. In the worker path, the `↑ N workers ·
X% utilisation` line covers the detect/fit phase only (its wall-clock
denominator excludes the separately barrier-phased FTM stage, which is
reported on its own line instead) — folding the two together would make a
run with substantial FTM time look artificially starved.

no separate calibration acquisition needed. Tiles a sample of frames, measures mean signal vs.
high-spatial-frequency (noise-only) variance per tile, and fits gain/offset by linear regression, and
draws a diagnostic signal-vs-noise-variance scatter + fitted line (R²) on the raw panel so the underlying
linearity assumption can be checked visually rather than trusted blindly. <b>Estimate</b> only computes —
it doesn't touch the Gain / Camera offset fields in Localisation settings itself; use <b>Get estimate</b>,

  <li><b>Readout noise σ</b> — camera dark-frame std, in electrons; set to 0 if unknown/negligible. Must
  include ANY spatially-white, frame-invariant noise, not just true per-frame read noise — a static

  Fourier content, so it biases the fitted offset the same way if left out. If both are present, combine
  them in quadrature (√(read_noise²+offset_std²), in photon-equivalent units); the default (2.89) matches

Implementation detail beyond the popup above: tiles are pooled and robustly
outlier-clipped (Tukey fences on `noisevar`, `pcfoClipPoints()` — a single
dead/saturated/masked tile can otherwise dominate an ordinary least-squares
fit) before a plain OLS linear regression (`pcfoRegress()`): the slope gives
gain, the intercept (combined with `pcfoRnstd`) gives offset. A leave-one-out
jackknife over the pooled points gives a rough ± uncertainty on both. The
diagnostic scatter (`drawPcfoPlot()`, the same left-panel-plot pattern as
calibration/FRC/NeNA curves) logs a low-linearity warning when R² < 0.3 (too
low a photon count is the most common cause; saturation, non-uniform
illumination or non-Poissonian noise are less common ones). Noise variance
(ADU²) commonly runs into the hundreds of thousands, where full tick labels
used to visually collide with the axis's own rotated name; both axes scale
into small (1 digit + 1 decimal) numbers plus a single `×10ⁿ` multiplier
instead (`axisScale()`, render module — see **render** in `CLAUDE.md`). See

**Choosing Magnification relative to localization precision.** `mag` (with
`pxnm`) sets the super-resolution pixel size (`pxnm`/`mag`) — too coarse a
pixel actively limits the resolution a reconstruction can show, independent
of how good the underlying localizations are. Nieuwenhuizen et al. (2013,
*Nat. Methods* 10, 557–562, §5.2 "Discretization" of the Supplementary
Information) derive this quantitatively for FRC-measured resolution:
binning into a pixel of size `l` acts as a low-pass filter on the FRC,
equivalent (at the resolution frequency) to inflating the effective
localization uncertainty from σ to a larger σ_eff via a `sinc(πql)` factor
(their Eq. S.79–S.80). Requiring the resulting resolution loss stay under
10% (their Eq. S.81–S.83) gives their stated conclusion: keep pixel size
`l` < R/4, where R ≈ 2πσ is the FRC resolution implied by precision σ —
i.e. **keep the super-resolution pixel size smaller than ≈1.57× the
dataset's typical localization precision** (R/4 = 2πσ/4 = πσ/2). Above
that, the pixel grid itself — not the fits — is what's limiting
resolution, regardless of `renderMode` below.
The same section (§5.3 "Data visualization") also shows that any
*isotropic linear* filter applied on top of binning — `fixed`'s own uniform
blur (`rblur`) included — does not change the FRC-measured resolution
(verified there to ~10⁻⁴, negligible against the FRC's own variance): FRC
depends only on the correlation between two half-datasets, not on the
magnitude of the frequency components a linear filter suppresses. A
*non-linear* visualization (their point, not this app's), by contrast,
cannot both stay unbiased (linear in localization density) and improve the
FRC over plain binning.

**Render mode.** `precision` renders each localization as its own bounded
(±3σ) 2D Gaussian, sized by its OWN fitted precision (`lpx`/`lpy`, the CRLB
from an MLE fit; a method with no true CRLB, e.g. phasor, falls back to
`rblur` for that localization) — the same convention Picasso's own default
renderer uses (`_draw_gaussian_loc`, `picasso/render.py`; Schnitzbauer,
Strauss, Schlichthaerle, Schueder & Jungmann, *Nat. Protoc.* 12, 1198–1228,
2017). This is a known trade-off, not a free improvement: rendering a
localization's own precision AS its display width convolves the true
structure with an extra Gaussian of that same width on top of the
localization error already inherent in it, which Martens, Turkowyd &
Endesfelder's SMLM analysis review (2022, *Front. Bioinform.* 1, 817254,
Module 6 "Image Generation") describes as "a loss of visual resolution …
resulting in a √2 resolution loss" relative to the precision alone — the
same review's Nyquist-Shannon argument for `mag` above this paragraph is
also theirs. The rendered σ is capped at 6 super-resolution pixels
regardless of magnification or how poor a single fit's precision is — the
±3σ bound alone only trims a *given* Gaussian's negligible tail, it doesn't
stop σ itself (∝ precision × magnification) from growing arbitrarily large
for a badly-localized outlier, which otherwise dominates render time out of
proportion to its share of the dataset. `fixed` is the original behaviour:
bin every localization into the reconstruction grid, then apply one uniform
blur (`rblur`) to the whole buffer — cost scales with the buffer's pixel
area, not the dataset, so it can get disproportionately expensive at high
magnification even for a sparse dataset, independent of precision quality;
per Nieuwenhuizen et al. above, this uniform blur is at least harmless to
the FRC-measured resolution, whatever its cost.

`dither` is a stochastic alternative to `precision`, for datasets large and
dense enough that the per-localization Gaussian's own cost (∝ σ², so ∝
magnification²) adds up: instead of rendering a localization's full
Gaussian into a window, it draws ONE random offset from a normal
distribution with that localization's own σ and bins the result to the
nearest pixel — O(1) per localization, independent of σ or magnification,
the same cost class as `fixed`'s plain counting pass. This is the classical
averaged-shifted-histogram / Monte-Carlo kernel-density argument (Scott,
*Ann. Statist.* 13(3), 1024–1040, 1985; the randomized-shift refinement:
Bourel, Fraiman & Ghattas, *Comput. Stat. Data Anal.* 79, 149–164, 2014): each
localization contributes one sample from its own posterior, and with many
independent localizations the pooled histogram converges to the same
density the analytic Gaussian sum computes exactly — without ever
evaluating one. Measured 10–24× faster than the capped `precision` splat on
a real, dense dataset (4.2M localizations), with a structurally faithful
reconstruction. The trade-off is visible single-sample grain that only
resolves into a smooth shape once many localizations overlap — on a sparse
dataset a single jittered dot doesn't converge to anything and looks like
noise rather than the soft blob `precision` still renders correctly there,
which is why `dither` isn't the default — including for **Live streaming**'s
own repeating cadence render (see [§8](#live-streaming)): an early version
of this feature forced that specific render to `dither` regardless of this
setting, on the reasoning that it repeats for the life of a session and
speed matters more there than any single render's grain — reverted after
testing, since a session looks grainy for as long as it stays small, which
is exactly the part of a live acquisition a user watches most closely.
`renderMode` is fully respected everywhere, including mid-session — switch
to `dither` by hand once a stream has grown large/dense enough that render
speed matters more than per-render grain. (Starting a live-streaming session
does set `renderMode` to `precision` at that moment — the sidebar's own
general default is `fixed`, see [§3](#render-params) — but this is a starting
value, not a lock: switching to `fixed`/`dither` afterward, including mid-
session, works exactly as it would for a normal Localize result.) The random
offsets are seeded
(not `Math.random()`), so the same localizations always dither identically
— panning/zooming or reopening the same dataset doesn't flicker.

`useGpu` is an opt-in WebGPU accelerator for supported heavy stages: fitting
(MLE and Phasor), reconstruction rendering, AIM drift correction and FRC.
Each stage decides independently whether the GPU is available and large
enough to be worth using; otherwise it logs a CPU fallback and keeps the same
result shape. GPU arithmetic is f32, so outputs are expected to be
scientifically equivalent, not byte-identical, to the CPU f64 path;
candidates near an MLE fitter's own accept/reject boundary can differ
slightly (Phasor has no such boundary — it never rejects a candidate, on
either path).

`hsvBlue` is a closed-loop full HSV hue cycle (240°, blue → cyan → green →
yellow → red → magenta → violet → 240° again, saturation/value pinned to 1)
matching a colour scheme used in the sSMLM paper's own figures — the only
cyclic map here, so the two ends of the mapped range deliberately land on
the same hue rather than two different ones; **Pair & plot sSMLM** (see
**sSMLM**) auto-selects it. The on-canvas colour-scale strip (`drawDepthBar()`) anchors
to the actual DATA's own right edge and vertical centre rather than a fixed
canvas corner — sSMLM's paired result usually only plots a sparse subset of
the full field of view, so a fixed corner could leave the bar floating in
empty space, disconnected from the content it's meant to label. The extent
is cached once per render (`srFull._locMaxXpx`/`_locMidYpx`, in native px)
and converted through the current zoom/pan on each draw, rather than
rescanning every localization on every pan/zoom redraw; falls back to the
bare top-right corner if there's no cached extent (e.g. a plot, not a real
reconstruction).

### Worker dispatch (`workers`) {#workers-params}

No page control — settings-JSON only.

*Module:* **workers** — see [§2](#workers).

| id | Label | Min | Max | Step | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `workerMinFrames` | Minimum frame count before parallelizing | 1 | — | 1 | 64 |
| `workerMinPxFrame` | Minimum pixels/frame before parallelizing | 1 | — | 1000 | 20000 |
| `workerMinTotalPx` | Minimum total volume (px) before parallelizing | 1 | — | 1,000,000 | 30,000,000 |
| `workerBatchTarget` | Target batches per worker | 1 | 64 | 1 | 24 |
| `workerBatchMin` | Minimum batch size (frames) | 1 | 256 | 1 | 8 |
| `workerBatchMax` | Maximum batch size (frames) | 1 | 1024 | 1 | 32 |

Dispatch condition: `frames ≥ workerMinFrames AND (pixels/frame ≥
workerMinPxFrame OR total pixels ≥ workerMinTotalPx)` — `workerMinFrames` is
a hard floor (short stacks always stay single-threaded, not worth the
overhead), while the per-frame-size and total-volume checks are an *or*, so
a many-small-frame stack (e.g. thousands of 64×64 frames) still parallelizes
via the volume threshold even though no single frame crosses the per-frame
one. See the **workers** module.

`workerBatchTarget`/`workerBatchMax` also bound how often the raw-panel live
preview can refresh during a worker-parallel Run: a batch's fit results only
become available once the whole batch completes, so batch size is a hard
floor on preview freshness independent of `rawPreviewMs` below.

### Localisation settings (`export`) {#export-params}

Camera ADU→photon conversion fields specifically.

*Module:* **export** — see [§2](#export).

| `camoffset` | Camera offset (ADU) | number | 0 | 65535 | 1 | 0 |
| `cameraExcessNoise` | Excess noise factor F² — 1 for sCMOS/CCD, 2 for an EMCCD at high gain (see **fit**) | number | 1 | 4 | 0.05 | 1 |

**In-app "more info…" popup**: `hint-export` no longer exists as its own
div — Gain/Camera offset now sit right below **Real-time update**, at the
TOP of Localisation settings (moved there, along with **Get estimate**,
requested — the three most-consulted controls in the whole module), and
their own "more info…" content was merged into `hint-detectfit` (shared with
**Detect**/**Fit method** above) rather than keeping a second button in the
same collapsed section — see that section's own marker for the current text.

Applied inside every fit function itself — `(raw−camoffset)×gain` — before
the pixel is used, so `photons`/`bg`/`bgstd` downstream (table, CSV, MLE's
CRLB) are already true photon units. See the **fit** module.

### 3D calibration (`3D calibration`) {#3d-calibration-params}

*Module:* **3D calibration** — see [§2](#3d-calibration).

<p>Two drift-estimation methods, picked by <b>Drift correction method</b>. <b>AIM</b> (adaptive intersection maximization; Ma et al., <i>Sci. Adv.</i> 2024, after <code>picasso/aim.py</code>; see <a href="https://websmlm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/09-references-further-reading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">References &amp; further reading</a>) is point-based — it needs real localizations to already exist, so <b>Localize first, then Correct drift.</b> <b>Cross correlation</b> is image-based instead: it works directly off the raw movie (no Localize needed to ESTIMATE the drift — Correct drift itself still needs existing localizations to apply the correction TO), averaging <b>Average # of frames</b> raw frames into one representative image per segment and finding each segment's own shift relative to the first by FFT cross-correlation. Both still apply the same way once estimated: corrected coordinates are used by the render and CSV, the raw coordinates are kept.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Average # of frames</b> is shared by both methods — smaller segments track faster drift more closely but are noisier to estimate.</li>
  <li><b>AIM</b>'s own settings, shown only when it's selected: <b>Search radius (nm)</b> must exceed the drift increment per segment — shrink the segment for faster drift; <b>Correct z too (3D)</b> additionally runs a 1-D z-drift correction (3D results only); <b>AIM sample %</b> deterministically subsamples each segment's own localizations before the search on a large, slow dataset (100% = no change, the default; a segment that's already small is never subsampled further).</li>
  <li><b>Cross correlation</b> has no additional settings of its own — no search radius (the whole frame is searched via FFT) and no z (a raw camera frame has no separate z channel to correlate against).</li>
  <li>Each run re-estimates from scratch, so settings can be swept and compared, and either method can be tried on the same result.</li>
  <li><b>Show drift</b> plots drift vs. frame by default; a small toggle in the raw panel's own title bar ("Show x/y path") switches to a single x/y trajectory instead, coloured by frame (time) using the current reconstruction colour map.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>NeNA</b> estimates the mean per-localization precision from the nearest-neighbour distance distribution — data-driven, and the honest single number for the phasor fit (which has no per-localization uncertainty). It assumes the labelled structure is <b>static</b>: consecutive-frame displacements must be localization error, not motion. A <b>diffusing probe</b> — e.g. Nile Red and similar solvatochromic dyes that partition into and move within membranes — adds diffusion to the distance and <b>inflates σ</b>. Fixed-target methods like <b>DNA-PAINT</b> (imager binding a static docking strand, as in the GATTAquant nanorulers) satisfy the assumption.</li>
  <li><b>FRC</b> reports image resolution at the <b>1/7</b> threshold by splitting the localisations into two independent halves (odd/even frames), rendering each and correlating over Fourier rings; <b>FSC</b> is the 3D shell version, once z exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>FRC folds in labelling density and drift while NeNA does not, so reporting both is diagnostic (they disagree when drift remains). Results go to the Log — run localisations first.</p>
<p><i>NeNA and FRC are new in 0.8.0 and still <b>experimental</b> — cross-check against established tools before relying on the numbers; FSC 3D is not yet implemented.</i></p>

<p>Pairs 0th/1st-order localizations from a diffraction grating placed in the emission path — each emitter appears twice per frame, offset by a wavelength-dependent distance at a <b>fixed, known bearing</b> (not just orientation — <b>Primary angle</b> is a genuine direction, e.g. 0° always means the 1st order sits to the same side of every 0th order in the image). A point qualifies as a 0th order only if it has a candidate on that bearing AND no candidate on the opposite bearing (which would mean it's more likely someone else's 1st order) — this needs no brightness signal, since real data shows brightness alone doesn't reliably tell 0th from 1st order here. The paired position is the <b>0th order's own</b> — undispersed, so its centroid is the true emitter position — not the midpoint between the two (that would blur position by up to half the per-emitter spectral offset). The inter-order distance is stored in its own <b>dist</b> field (never <b>z</b> — kept independent so a future 3D-fit result could carry real depth and spectral distance at once), so the depth-coding render option (Rendering settings → Colour by depth/distance) shows it directly as a wavelength proxy with no other change needed. The 1st order's own raw position and the pair's own directed bearing are also kept, as <b>x2</b>/<b>y2</b>/<b>pairAngle</b> — a pair's full geometry, not just distance and the 0th order's own position. Localizations that don't find an unambiguous pair within the window are dropped from the result entirely.</p>
<p>Localizing with <b>Gauss MLE rotated elliptical</b> first (Fit method, above — <b>3D localisation</b> unchecked fixes its angle to Primary angle below, exactly this section's own bearing) gives BOTH orders a genuine per-axis σx/σy after <b>Pair &amp; plot sSMLM</b>, instead of the single symmetric-σ proxy (<code>sigma1st</code>) every other method reports for the spectrally-smeared 1st order.</p>
<p><b>Background profile</b> (Rectangle/Circle, default Rectangle) is the shape Preview pairs' own automatic distance fit assumes for the region the localizations occupy, when modelling the "random unpaired pairs" background — a rectangular camera FOV and a circular field-stop/aperture are both real optical setups, and which one applies isn't reliably guessable from the point cloud alone, so it's a plain choice rather than auto-detected. Changing it re-fits automatically once a fit already exists, rather than just clearing the old one. See <a href="https://websmlm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/09-references-further-reading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">References &amp; further reading</a> for the two background formulas' own citations.</p>
<p><b>Preview pairs</b> computes the candidate pool AND immediately fits it (no separate button needed — Distance min/max/Primary angle/Angle tolerance below are filled in automatically, so they already reflect this dataset's own real peak instead of generic defaults): Distance min/max from a fitted background-plus-Gaussian-signal model (<b>Background profile</b> picks whether the background assumes a rectangular or circular region), Primary angle/Angle tolerance from the angle histogram's own peak (its half-max width) — all four are starting points you can still widen by hand; changing <b>Background profile</b> re-fits automatically too. <b>Show histograms</b> draws the underlying data: a distance histogram (every candidate pair in range, any angle) by default, or a polar (rose) angle histogram restricted to the current distance window via the toggle next to the raw panel's own title (labelled <b>Distances</b>/<b>Angles</b>, whichever it would switch to). Both histograms are accumulated across ALL frames (only same-frame localizations are ever compared to each other — the accumulation just pools every frame's own candidates into one plot); both also overlay their own fitted curve. Narrow the fields further by typing, or by dragging the marker lines directly on either plot (two vertical lines on <b>Distances</b>; a magenta Primary-angle line plus two red tolerance lines, rotating around the origin, on <b>Angles</b>) — then click <b>Pair &amp; plot sSMLM</b> to commit.</p>
<p><b>Pair &amp; plot sSMLM</b> replaces the current localizations with one row per accepted pair (refuses if the current result already has real 3D <b>z</b> from an astigmatic fit method, or is already-paired output) and switches the reconstruction's own Colour map to the HSV (blue loop) scheme automatically. <b>Unpair</b> restores the original, unpaired localizations, AND restores whichever Colour map was selected before Pair switched it — not left on HSV (blue loop) regardless of what it replaced.</p>

<!-- /HINT:sSMLM -->

`sSmlmAngleCenter` ("Primary angle" in the UI) is a genuine SIGNED bearing
(the 1st order's fixed direction from its 0th order), not an undirected
line — see §2's **sSMLM** entry for why. The distance/angle defaults match
the deposited reference dataset's own grating dispersion
(`experimental_data/sSMLM_Fig2_locs.csv`) — a different setup's dispersion
sits elsewhere, so don't trust these blind. **Preview pairs** fetches
candidates over a WIDE, fixed scan — distance 0–6000 nm (wider still if
Distance max is already past that) at any angle — ignoring the
Distance/Angle fields entirely. The **Distances** view reuses the table
module's own `computeHist()`/`drawHistogram()` (fed candidate values
instead of a table column); the **Angles** view renders as a dedicated
polar (rose) plot, `drawSSmlmAnglePolar()`, not that shared cartesian
histogram — angle data wraps at 360°, which a linear x-axis handles
poorly (see below). **Show histograms** (one button, merging what used to
be two —
a toggle next to the raw panel's own title, labelled **Distances** or
**Angles**, switches between the two views; **Distances** shown first)
plots the full wide scan with the *currently configured* Distance min/max
overlaid as vertical reference lines (read live, so editing the fields
and re-clicking moves the lines without a fresh Preview) — showing the
whole distance picture, not just whatever's inside the window, makes it
visible whether the window is actually sitting on the real peak. On the
**Distances** view, those two lines are directly draggable (hover turns the
cursor into a resize arrow) — dragging one live-updates the Distance min/
max field and redraws the histogram continuously, only firing the field's
own `change` event (and whatever else reacts to it) once on release, not
on every pointer move. The
**Angles** view, by contrast, *does* restrict to the currently configured
distance window (also read live) — the angle signal is only sharp within
the real peak, so pooling in the wide scan's off-peak distances would just
dilute it with background — and renders as a **polar (rose) histogram**,
letterboxed SQUARE rather than the app's usual 4:3 (a circle wastes space
in a non-square box), instead of a cartesian bar chart: fixed 2° bins around the full circle,
0°=right/90°=top, increasing counterclockwise (standard math convention),
each bin's own outer radius scaled by its count, drawn as one continuous
stepped outline rather than individual pie-slice wedges. It plots each
candidate's bearing AND its exact reverse (`rawAngle`/`rawAngle+180`, both
taken mod 360°): a candidate's *raw* single bearing depends on which of
its two points happens to have the smaller array index, an accident of
row order that (verified against the real reference CSV) is not evenly
split and would otherwise make the two peaks look wildly, misleadingly
unequal; plotting both directions makes them come out equal, as an
undirected diagnostic should — the two resulting peaks land opposite each
other on the circle (180° apart) rather than being awkwardly split across
a wrap point the way a linear axis would show them. It also overlays its
own fitted curve — a flat background plus a Gaussian signal bump, fit on
the doubled-bearing data FOLDED to its true 180° period first (the two
peaks are genuine mirrors of the same underlying signal, not independent —
folding merges them so the fit explains both at once instead of locking
onto whichever looks marginally taller and treating the other as
unexplained). (This plot has no
interactive hover the way the Distances view does — a deliberate v1 scope
limit — but its own three marker lines ARE draggable, see below.) Both histograms accumulate same-frame
candidates across every frame in the stack (never cross-frame pairs) —
one pooled plot, not one frame's worth. **Preview pairs**' own automatic
fit (there is no separate "Fit" button — see the hint above) sets BOTH
windows the moment it runs, and re-runs whenever **Background profile**
changes too. Distance min/max come from a two-component mixture
fit against the (always-wide) distance histogram: a theoretical
**background** term — the closed-form PDF of the distance between two
independent, uniformly random, unpaired points confined to the region the
localizations actually occupy (a rectangle or a circle, per **Background
profile**; see [§9](#9-references-further-reading) for the Philip 2007/
MathWorld citations) — plus a **Gaussian signal** term on top, the real
distance between an emitter's spectrally-split 0th/1st-order images. Fit
via Levenberg-Marquardt (only 4 free parameters — the background shape's
own size is derived from the localization bounding box, not fit), it sets
Distance min/max to the fitted peak ±3σ (a generous starting window, not a
real-data-validated constant the way the angle half-max-doubling below
is — clamped by whichever is tighter of a fixed 10000 nm ceiling or the
localization bounding box's own diagonal, since no two localizations can
be farther apart than that) and overlays the fitted curve on the distance
histogram itself. **Distance min/max are capped at 10000 nm** — a fixed
ceiling matching a diffraction-grating or wedge-prism setup's own
sub-µm-to-few-µm dispersion; a dual-view/image-splitter TIRF rig, whose
donor/acceptor channels sit tens of micrometers apart on the same sensor,
needs **Pairing method: Via channel matching** instead (no such cap) —
this histogram-based method's own wide diagnostic scan (**Preview
pairs**, which always covers at least 6000 nm or the current Distance
max, whichever is larger) is tuned for the small-separation case, and
scaling it to the data's full physical extent instead diluted a
genuinely small real peak across an unnecessarily large search range.
Primary angle/Angle tolerance are then estimated directly from that same
(now correctly windowed) doubled-bearing data: peak-bin detection (2°
bins) + half-max-width walk, DOUBLED as a safety margin (the raw half-max
width alone measured ~1° on the real reference dataset, vs. the ~5° that
actually worked well by hand) — a simple, defensible estimate (not a full
Gaussian fit, matching the bar this app's other auxiliary estimates like
PCFO/NeNA set), still usually conservative, meant as a starting point you
can widen further by hand rather than a final answer. Both histograms
also overlay the currently configured window: the distance histogram
draws vertical Distance min/max marker lines; the angle plot draws three
dashed lines through the origin — a magenta one at Primary angle itself,
and two red ones at Primary angle ± Angle tolerance — each a full
diameter, so the red pair together bound the accepted wedge on both sides
of the circle by construction, drawn a little past the histogram's own
outer edge (rather than stopping exactly at it) for an easier drag target.
All three lines are directly draggable
(hover turns the cursor into a grab hand), same idea as the Distances
view's own draggable min/max lines but rotational instead of linear:
dragging the magenta line sets Primary angle to wherever you drag it;
dragging either red line sets Angle tolerance from how far you dragged it
from the (live) Primary angle — the OTHER red line moves with it,
mirrored, since both are always drawn at the same distance from centre;
a red line can be dragged arbitrarily close to the magenta one but never
past or onto it. Both refresh live as
you edit any of the four fields while that histogram is on screen (or
immediately after **Preview pairs**' own automatic fit runs), no manual
re-click needed. Narrow these fields (by hand or via the fit) to the real
peak, then commit with **Pair & plot sSMLM**. See
[§2](#2-module-reference)'s **sSMLM** entry for the full pairing algorithm
and why this workflow — rather than automatic angle detection — was chosen
for the first implementation.

<p>Single-molecule FRET (donor/acceptor pair analysis), <b>experimental</b> and early — v1 is the first two steps: finding real emitter positions, then reading out their intensity over time.</p>
<p><b>Analyse FRET</b> (default checked, right below <b>Average # of frames</b>) makes explicit that this module also works as a plain time-traces tool, not only a FRET one — unticking it disables/greys out <b>Pair DD + DA</b> (the one control that only makes sense once a real donor/acceptor pair is wanted); <b>Localize SOI</b>, <b>Get (FRET) data</b> and <b>Load/Save (FRET) data</b> all stay fully usable regardless. With <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> on and <b>Analyse FRET</b> off, <b>Get (FRET) data</b> still plots real <b>DD</b> and <b>AA</b> — there's just no donor→acceptor pair to derive an E/S value from, so the <b>E(S) histogram</b> stays unavailable, same as for any other unpaired result.</p>
<p><b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> (default unchecked) is for movies where the excitation laser alternates frame-by-frame (ALEX) — checking it reveals <b>First frame</b>, picking whether the movie's own first frame is a direct donor- or direct acceptor-excitation frame. This also affects the <b>Data projection</b> view (shown before any Localize/Calibration result exists) and smFRET's own <b>SOI composite</b> (once Localize SOI has run) the same way: both share one toggle next to the panel title (named for whichever channel it would switch to) that averages only the even- or only the odd-indexed frames instead of the whole movie, so the two excitation channels can be inspected — or localized — separately. Checking this box after a composite already exists recomputes it automatically.</p>
<p><b>Localize SOI</b> averages the first <b>Average # of frames</b> frames (from frame 1) into one stable composite — real molecule positions stay bright and stack up in an average the way transient noise doesn't — then detects and fits each real emitter ROI once on that composite, the same "average, then detect once" approach <b>3D calibration</b>'s own <b>Fix bead x,y</b> uses. Uses the current detection/fit settings (Localisation settings). Results ("sites of interest", SOI) are shown in the reconstruction panel: ROI boxes + fit crosshairs over the composite image, not a real reconstruction — and also become the current result everywhere else (<b>View data/filtering</b>, <b>Save data</b>, and <b>Pairing (sSMLM &amp; FRET)</b>'s own <b>Preview pairs</b>/<b>Pair &amp; plot sSMLM</b>, useful for pairing a donor/acceptor SOI candidate the same way sSMLM pairs a 0th/1st order — see <b>Pair DD + DA</b> below for a shortcut that does this from right here), replacing whatever the current result was before. <b>Fix sites of interest (SOI)</b> is checked automatically once sites are found — it's a status flag, not something you need to check by hand — and unchecking it discards the sites, that result, and both panels return to normal. Loading a different movie does NOT uncheck it by itself (only Localize SOI itself has any real consequence for it). With <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> checked, the log line also breaks the total down by channel: it reports the candidate count on the channel just localized AND runs a second, on-demand detect+fit pass on the OTHER channel purely to report its own independent count too (no pairing has run yet at this point, so there's no real donor/acceptor IDENTITY to split by — see below).</p>
<p>Once an SOI composite is showing, changing <b>Average # of frames</b> or any Localisation settings field that affects detection (Threshold, σ_PSF, Window radius, the detection filter or its own threshold, Exact ±3σ box) re-runs <b>Localize SOI</b> automatically, no re-click needed — real SOI signals are commonly faint, so expect to hand-tune the threshold down and watch the composite update live rather than getting everything on the first try. Zoom/pan is preserved across each auto-refresh (only resets on an actual frame-size change), the same as the raw frame panel's own live preview, so zooming in on one faint candidate while tuning the threshold doesn't keep snapping back out. Whenever either composite is showing, a <b>Contrast</b> slider appears next to the reconstruction panel too (same fixed black/white stretch as the raw panel's own). Each of the two channels (<b>DD+DA</b>/<b>AA</b>, or <b>Donor</b>/<b>Acceptor dir. exc.</b> before Localize SOI) remembers its own Contrast range independently — the first time a channel's composite is shown it's auto-estimated, but a by-hand adjustment sticks: toggling to the other channel and back does not silently reset it. Clicking <b>Auto</b> explicitly reverts the CURRENT channel back to auto-estimating on future toggles.</p>
<p><b>Pairing method</b> picks which of two genuinely different approaches <b>Pair DD + DA</b> below actually runs — they target different optical layouts, not overlapping options, so the right choice depends on your setup rather than being a quality trade-off. <b>Via distances and angles</b> (default) fits a Distance/Angle histogram — suits an OVERLAPPING-region setup (diffraction-grating/prism), where donor and acceptor images share the same general sensor area and are only distinguished by a small wavelength-dependent dispersion offset. <b>Via channel matching</b> directly registers two independently-detected point sets instead — suits a spatially SEPARATED setup (dual-view/image-splitter), where a histogram-based fit can't tell a genuine peak apart from a purely geometric bias: in a field of view much wider than tall, random point pairs are naturally more likely to be oriented along the long axis regardless of any real signal, and that axis commonly coincides with the true physical donor→acceptor bearing for a horizontal split. Selecting <b>Via channel matching</b> reveals <b>Align channels match tolerance (px)</b> (default 4), which controls how close a mapped point must land to a real one to count as a match ONCE THE GEOMETRIC TRANSFORM HAS CONVERGED — an initial coarse translation-only search only seeds a full affine fit (rotation + scale + shear + translation, refined over a few rounds of fit-then-re-match at progressively tighter tolerance), since a real optical dual-view/image-splitter path commonly has a small relative rotation or magnification difference between its two channels that a plain shift can't capture; the converged mapping is expected to hold to genuine sub-pixel-to-few-px accuracy, so widen this only if genuine matches are still being missed after that refinement, not to compensate for an uncorrected shift. Changing it re-runs <b>Pair DD + DA</b> automatically whenever a pairing already exists.</p>
<p><b>Pair DD + DA</b> runs whichever method <b>Pairing method</b> selects, using the current sites of interest. <b>Via distances and angles</b> runs <b>Pairing (sSMLM &amp; FRET)</b>'s own candidate-fit-and-pair steps (the same computation <b>Preview pairs</b> then <b>Pair &amp; plot sSMLM</b> do): it fits the distance/angle window, redraws the raw (left) panel with the resulting Distances/Angles histogram, and commits the pairing (writing each site's paired acceptor position/distance) — but skips the reconstruction panel's own side effects (no colour-map switch, no z-range change, no re-render), so it doesn't disturb whichever composite or time trace the reconstruction (right) panel is currently showing. With <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> ticked, this always pairs the <b>direct donor excitation</b> channel's own sites — refuses with a log message if the SOI composite currently showing is the acceptor-excitation one instead; without ALEX there's only one channel, so it just runs. <b>Via channel matching</b> instead finds the x-position GAP between the two channels directly from where the sites of interest themselves are detected (not an assumed frame-half-width), splits into a DD region and a DA region, builds a "truth" pool for the acceptor side — DA candidates plus, with ALEX on, a fresh independent AA localization (DA alone without ALEX) — then searches for the initial displacement that maximises how many DD points land near a real truth point once shifted by it (starting from half the frame width at 180°), refines that shift into a full geometric transform (rotation + scale + shear on top of translation) by repeatedly fitting the mapping from the current matches and re-matching at a progressively tighter tolerance, and the final match set under the converged transform becomes the pairing directly, no separate histogram/window step needed. Unlike <b>Via distances and angles</b>, a successful <b>Via channel matching</b> run DOES touch the reconstruction (right) panel: it automatically shows an <b>Alignment overlay</b> — the donor channel (green), warped through the just-fitted transform, composited over the acceptor/DA channel (magenta), so a genuinely well-registered feature reads white and a real misalignment shows as separated green/magenta fringes — a direct visual check of the transform's own quality. A new <b>Show alignment</b>/<b>Show SOI composite</b> toggle next to the panel title switches back to the ordinary SOI composite and back again without recomputing anything (also swapping <b>Show alignment</b> in for the SOI composite's own <b>DD+DA</b>/<b>AA</b> cycle button while the overlay is up, since that button's own cycle has nothing to do with the overlay). The overlay shares the SOI composite's own <b>Contrast</b> slider — dragging it re-stretches both the green and magenta channels together from cached, already-warped data, no need to recompute the transform. Either way, once a pairing succeeds and the SOI composite is still showing, every site that became the ACCEPTOR side of a pair has its own ROI box and crosshair recoloured — the matching donor site keeps its usual colour, since a coloured box marks "this is the confirmed acceptor," not just "this site paired." <b>Via distances and angles</b> always colours dark orange (every acceptor position there is another entry of the SAME donor-excitation composite that's on screen). <b>Via channel matching</b> colours dark orange too when the match came from that same DA region, but a match sourced from the separate, independently-fit AA composite (only possible with ALEX on) instead colours gold — a real but purely geometric, nearest-neighbour match rather than one validated against data visible in the composite you're looking at, worth being able to tell apart at a glance. The match itself uses a small position tolerance (a few px) rather than requiring an exact coordinate match, since an AA-sourced position comes from a genuinely different image/fit pass than the composite's own site list — an acceptor position with no sufficiently close site of interest nearby (rare, but possible for a noisier AA fit) is left in its ordinary colour even though it IS part of a real pair. Every site stays visible regardless, so it's easy to see how many (and which) actually paired, rather than the unpaired majority disappearing — toggling the <b>DD+DA</b>/<b>AA</b> composite view next to the reconstruction title afterward does NOT lose this. Once it succeeds, <b>Get FRET data</b> below automatically reads the resulting paired positions and splits DD into DD/DA.</p>
<p><b>Position donor</b> (shown once <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> is checked) answers the question the doubled-bearing pairing data can't answer on its own: which of the two candidate bearings — always exactly 180° apart — actually points from the donor toward the acceptor. Greyed out — before <b>Localize SOI</b> has even run, and again any time the current pairing session ends (<b>Unpair</b>, a fresh <b>Localize SOI</b>, or unchecking <b>Fix sites of interest (SOI)</b>) — until <b>Pairing (sSMLM &amp; FRET)</b>'s own angle fit has actually run at least once (from <b>Preview pairs</b> or <b>Pair DD + DA</b>) — its placeholder bearing before that has no real data behind it, so there's nothing meaningful to choose between yet. Once enabled, its two options are frozen at that fit and stay fixed while you toggle between them; picking one directly sets that module's own <b>Primary angle</b> and re-pairs. There's no automatic way to tell which of the two is physically correct ahead of time — try both and compare the resulting Get FRET data AA signal.</p>
<p><b>Get FRET data</b> extracts every site's intensity — its known x,y only picks which window to look at, never re-detected — in every frame of the loaded movie, then plots the resulting intensity-vs-time curve(s) in the raw (left) panel, 4:3 letterboxed like every other plot here, <b>zoomable along the x-axis</b> (mouse wheel/pinch, same as the line-profile plot; double-click to reset). It's available as soon as sites of interest exist — before any pairing, it plots just <b>DD</b> (green). Once paired (<b>Pair DD + DA</b> above), DD splits into <b>DD</b> and <b>DA</b> (magenta) — DA is the LEADING position: with <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> also checked, <b>AA</b> (blue) is sampled at that same DA-established acceptor position too, on the direct-acceptor-excitation frames. There is currently no other option for where AA is sampled from. By default this fits a standard 2D Gaussian (seeded at the site, position free to move) at each frame; check <b>Aperture photometry (no fit)</b> to instead use a published aperture-photometry method (a circular signal disk plus a separate background annulus, background estimated by its 56th percentile) with no fit to diverge — recommended if the default trace still shows an implausible spike. <b>Set negative intensities to zero</b> (default checked) floors that method's own background-subtracted result at 0; untick it to keep a genuinely negative computed value instead, better for fitting an intensity distribution (e.g. an OFF-state population centred near zero with a real negative tail) than an artificial floor allows — a rejected fit still reports 0 either way. Toggling either of these two (or <b>Apply drift correction</b>, below) while a trace is already showing re-extracts every site's data with the new setting but keeps showing the SAME site at the SAME x-zoom — only a fresh click of <b>Get FRET data</b> itself jumps back to site 1. While a time trace is showing, the frame scrubber below the panel is replaced by a <b>site</b> scrubber — mouse wheel (over its slider) or the bar below the panel scrolls through sites instead of frames — and a <b>Show raw frame</b>/<b>Show time trace</b> toggle next to the panel title switches back and forth between the plot and the live frame (with its own ordinary Frame scrubber) without discarding the computed traces. Below the DD/DA/AA plot, a second stacked plot — sharing the same time x-axis — shows the CURRENT site's own <b>E</b> (orange) and, once ALEX and AA data are both present, <b>S</b> (teal) as a function of time, fixed to the conventional [0,1] range; before a pairing exists it shows a placeholder message instead.</p>
<p><b>Apply drift correction</b> (default OFF) estimates drift on the loaded movie and shifts each frame's own extraction window to follow it before reading DD/DA/AA intensities — useful when a site of interest's own position isn't perfectly stationary over a long acquisition. Uses whichever <b>Drift correction method</b>/settings are currently configured in <b>Drift correction</b>'s own sidebar section (see <a href="#drift-params">its own reference</a>): <b>Cross correlation</b> runs directly on the raw movie, no Localize needed just to estimate it; <b>AIM</b> needs real localizations first, so this runs one full, silent Localize pass across the whole movie behind the scenes (using the current detection/fit settings) — a real, sometimes substantial added cost, unlike Cross correlation. Either way, the estimated drift is anchored to frame 0 (a site's own fixed x,y is treated as "how it looked when Localize SOI averaged it", effectively frame 0), so every other frame's own extraction position is derived as an offset from that fixed reference — not from an arbitrary drift-curve reference point the way <b>Correct drift</b>'s own AIM-based reconstruction correction can be.</p>
<p><b>Save FRET data</b> saves every site's own DD/DA/AA (whichever apply) intensity-vs-time trace as one JSON file, one record per site — each carrying its own <code>x</code>/<code>y</code> (and <code>x2</code>/<code>y2</code> once paired), a <code>time_s</code> array, and <code>photonsDD</code>/<code>photonsDA</code>/<code>photonsAA</code> (whichever exist for that site). A gap (no fit attempted that frame, or a frame that wasn't this channel's own turn under ALEX) is written as JSON's native <code>null</code>. Also saves the pooled <b>E(S) histogram</b> data — the exact same per-sample values that plot would draw, as flat arrays rather than pre-binned counts, so an external tool can re-bin them however it likes — together with the <b>DD + DA</b>/<b>AA</b> range used to pool them (a missing/<code>null</code> max means no upper limit was set), whenever a real DD+DA pairing exists (a 1D <code>pooled_E</code> array alone, or both <code>pooled_E</code> and <code>pooled_S</code> once ALEX + AA data are both present). Enabled as soon as <b>Get FRET data</b> has produced a result. The file also records <code>frametime_s</code>, <code>alex_enabled</code> and <code>alex_first_frame</code> — the settings needed to redraw the trace correctly, not just the raw numbers.</p>
<p><b>Load FRET data</b> reverses this — loads a previously-exported file and shows its Time trace plot / <b>E(S) histogram</b> directly, with no raw movie, <b>Localize SOI</b> or pairing needed at all: it restores <b>Frame time (s)</b>/<b>Alternating-laser excitation</b>/<b>First frame</b> and, when present, the <b>DD + DA</b>/<b>AA</b> range from the file (a missing/<code>null</code> max restores "no upper limit", not whatever the sidebar already had) so both plots redraw exactly as they looked when exported, then reconstructs everything the plots need from the file's own numbers alone. The one thing it can't restore is the <b>SOI composite</b> or the ROI thumbnails' own pixel crops — the composite image itself was never part of this file, only the fitted positions and intensities — so the reconstruction panel is left untouched, and thumbnails only render (and only look meaningful) if a movie happens to already be loaded that's genuinely the same one the traces came from.</p>
<p><b>E(S) histogram</b> pools every site's own DD/DA/AA samples across ALL time points into one population-level FRET histogram, drawn in the <b>reconstruction (right)</b> panel — deliberately not the raw (left) one, so it can sit alongside the Time trace plot (or the SOI composite) rather than replacing it. A real per-SITE trace naturally has too few points to histogram meaningfully on its own, so this deliberately mixes every site and every frame into one plot (the Time trace plot's own second E/S-vs-time subplot, above, is the per-site, time-resolved complement to this pooled, population-level one). Without ALEX (or without AA data), it's a 1D histogram of E = DA/(DD+DA). With ALEX and AA data, it's a 2D joint density plot of E vs. <b>S</b> = (DD+DA)/(AA+DD+DA) (the standard ALEX stoichiometry), rendered as hexagonally-tiled bins (no blurring — each hexagon's own fill colour, viridis, reflects its own sample count directly, no colour bar needed), with E's own 1D histogram (with its own count axis, extending the main plot's own left S-axis line upward) along the top and S's own (likewise, extending the main plot's own bottom E-axis line rightward) along the right — the classic ALEX "E-S" plot layout, sized so the two marginal histograms get real visual room rather than being squeezed into thin strips beside a dominant central density plot. <b>DD + DA</b> (and, in E/S mode, <b>AA</b>) — shown as dual-range slider rows underneath the reconstruction panel, styled the same as the raw panel's own <b>Contrast</b> slider (a min AND a max handle, paired min/max number boxes, no +/− steppers) — are per-SAMPLE burst-selection RANGES: a (site, time point) sample is only included once its own donor-excitation total (or, for AA, its own direct-acceptor-excitation) intensity clears the minimum AND stays under the maximum, the standard technique for excluding a sample too dim (or, once a max is set, too bright — e.g. a saturated pixel or outlier) for E (or S) to be a meaningful ratio rather than noise. Both ranges default to 0–∞ (no upper limit) — the Max box is simply left blank; clearing it manually reverts to no limit again. Both sliders' own ceiling is set from the actual loaded traces' observed intensity range, and dragging either handle (or typing a value into either box) redraws live. DD, DA, and — in E/S mode — AA are each also required strictly greater than 0 individually, not just their sums: a rejected/non-converged fit reports a real, meaningful 0 on just one channel, which would otherwise clamp E (or S) to exactly 0 or 1 and pile spurious samples at the histogram's own edges rather than dropping them. Showing either plot hides the SOI composite's own Contrast slider (meaningless here) and folds into the reconstruction panel's own donor/acceptor toggle (next to its title) as a THIRD stop — with <b>Alternating-laser excitation</b> on, that button now cycles DD+DA composite → AA composite → E/S histogram → back to DD+DA, so you can flip between all three without recomputing anything.</p>
<p>The Time trace plot inset its own small <b>ROI</b> thumbnails (DD/DA/AA, shown only for whichever channel actually exists for the current site) below the graph — a contrast-stretched crop of the real camera pixels around each channel's own extraction position, one FIXED representative frame per channel (the first donor-excitation frame for DD/DA, the first acceptor-excitation frame for AA), not scrubbed with the main Frame slider — each marked with a magenta crosshair at the EXACT fitted sub-pixel position used for that channel's own extraction, so you can check both that a position genuinely sits on a molecule and that the fit itself actually landed there. Update automatically when scrubbing between sites. The SOI composite (right panel) also highlights the currently-shown site directly — a blue circle around its DD position (and, once paired, a second one around its DA/AA position, joined by a line), so it's easy to see where in the composite the trace you're looking at actually came from while scrolling through sites.</p>
<p><i>If <b>Average # of frames</b> is set higher than the loaded movie's own frame count, it's silently clamped to the whole movie.</i></p>

`frametime` (renamed from `sptFrameTime` in v0.12.1-dev) has no page control

like pixel size, not something spt-specific despite being this module's
only current consumer. See [§1](#sidebar-pxnm-frametime) for the relocation

<p><b>Apply segmentation</b> (default unchecked) reveals <b>Load segm. image</b> — loads a separate integer-labelled mask (0 = background, 1/2/3/… = cell number, same file types as <b>Load movie</b>), shown in the raw panel recoloured so adjacent cells are visually distinct, and builds an internal per-cell table (id, centre of mass, area in px). <b>Show image</b> re-shows it later without reloading the file, opening on the segmentation image by default; a toggle next to the raw panel's own title switches to a histogram of the cell-area distribution (px) and back — use it to judge <b>Min./Max. cell area (px)</b>, which gate which cells actually get tracked (default 50–∞).</p>
<p>Once a segmentation image is loaded, <b>SMLM reconstruction</b>'s panel title gains a <b>Show segm.</b> button — swaps the panel to the segmented cells (opaque, same colours as the raw-panel view) with the same reconstruction drawn on top, its black background made highly transparent (sparse localizations get a minimum visible brightness so they don't disappear against a bright cell colour), so you can check localizations line up with their cells before tracking (click again, now <b>Show recon.</b>, to go back). If you correct <b>Pixel size (nm)</b> after loading the segmentation image, the segmentation's on-screen size rescales relative to the (unmoving) localizations — using its value at load time as the reference, since localization positions themselves never depend on it: correcting it upward grows the segmentation's apparent coverage, downward shrinks it.</p>
<p>With segmentation applied, <b>Track</b> links each qualifying cell's own localizations SEPARATELY (a track can never cross a cell boundary), rather than one whole-field-of-view pass — ported from the user's own <code>sptPALM-Python</code> pipeline's <code>apply_cell_segmentation_sptPALM.py</code>/<code>tracking_sptPALM.py</code> (<code>use_segmentations</code> branch). Every localization gets a <code>cell_id</code> (−1 if it's background or inside a cell outside the area range — never tracked) and, only once segmentation is applied, a <code>cell_area [px]</code> column alongside it in **Save data**/the table.</p>
<p>Links each frame's localizations onto the previous frames' active tracks — a trackpy-<b>inspired</b> variant (same <code>search_range</code>/<code>memory</code> terminology and linking philosophy as the Python <code>trackpy</code> package), not a literal port of its source, since there's no way to call real Python trackpy from a static HTML page. Frame-to-frame candidates within <b>Search range</b> are grouped into small connected clusters and each solved via an optimal (minimum total squared displacement) assignment, which keeps crossing trajectories from swapping identity in the common case. <b>Memory</b> lets a track skip up to that many frames with no detection and still be relinked when it reappears.</p>
<p>Every localization gets a <code>track_id</code> (even length-1 tracks); track-length filtering happens only at the diffusion-coefficient step. <b>Track</b> is safe to re-run any time — it only sets/overwrites <code>track_id</code>/<code>D_coeff</code>, never drops or replaces rows, so there's no separate "original vs. tracked" state to manage the way sSMLM's Pair/Unpair needs.</p>
<p>One diffusion coefficient (D, µm²/s) is computed per track with at least <b>Min track length</b> localizations, from the gap-corrected mean of ALL of that track's own single-frame squared displacements (an average, not a linear MSD-vs-lag-time fit) — corrected for <b>Localization error</b>: D = MSD/(4·frame time) − error²/frame time. Changing <b>Frame time</b> (pinned in the sidebar next to <b>Pixel size (nm)</b>, not inside this section) or <b>Localization error</b> after <b>Track</b> has run instantly rescales every already-computed D (and the shown histogram) from cached per-track MSDs, no re-tracking needed — only <b>Search range</b>/<b>Memory</b>/<b>Min track length</b> require a fresh <b>Track</b> click, since those change which tracks/steps exist in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Track</b> immediately plots a histogram of D (log<sub>10</sub>-binned — D commonly spans orders of magnitude between bound/slow and free/fast populations) in the raw panel; a track whose corrected D comes out non-positive (near-immobile/very-short tracks, where MSD can end up below the subtracted error term) is excluded from that histogram rather than pooled into a fake spike, with the excluded count logged. <b>D plot min/max</b> set the histogram's own display range (tracks outside it are likewise excluded from the plot only — the logged mean/median D always reflect every qualifying track, not just the plotted window); defaults match the reference pipeline's own histogram range. <b>Show histograms</b> redraws it later without re-tracking. A toggle next to the raw panel's own title (labelled <b>Diffusion</b> or <b>Track length</b>, whichever it would switch to) swaps to the underlying track-length distribution instead (every linked track, log-scaled count axis since it usually falls off steeply) with an overlaid exponential fit (count ~ e<sup>−L/τ</sup>, a photobleaching-limited survival model) — τ is logged in both locs and seconds (via <b>Frame time</b>); a marker shows the current <b>Min track length</b> and moves live as that field is edited (no re-Track needed — only the marker moves, the bars themselves don't depend on it), so use the histogram to judge whether it's set sensibly for this data. If a fresh <b>Track</b> run has no track meeting <b>Min track length</b> for a D estimate, <b>Show histograms</b> opens on the track-length view instead of an empty D plot.</p>
<p><b>Show tracks</b> plots a subset of tracks as lines directly on the <b>SMLM reconstruction</b> (thickness = one reconstruction pixel's own on-screen size at the current zoom, capped so zooming in a long way can't blow a track up into an oversized shape), a filled circle marking each track's own start point (diameter = 2x the line thickness, same colour as the line), and its track number in white on a semi-transparent grey backing box (matching the scale bar's own) for legibility — growing larger the further you zoom in — legible tracks require zooming in, since real data is usually dense. Only tracks meeting <b>Min track length</b> are eligible (the same threshold Track's own D estimate uses); <b>Show tracks (%)</b> (default 10%) then samples a fixed, reproducible percentage of those, so a dense dataset stays plottable — raising it never reshuffles the tracks already shown, it only reveals more, and the exact same track identities come up every time for a given dataset. <b>Colour tracks by mean D</b> (checked by default) colours each track by its own mean diffusion coefficient (the same colour ramp as <b>Fire (hot)</b>, normalised against <b>D plot min/max</b>, with a colour-scale legend centred along the panel's right edge while it's checked — a track with no qualifying D estimate, e.g. too short, is drawn a neutral grey instead); uncheck it for plain magenta tracks instead. Click a track (anywhere along its own line) to select it — it highlights magenta in colour-by-D mode, or the same green the raw panel's own ROI boxes use otherwise; click it again, or a different track, to change the selection. Turning the overlay on also switches the reconstruction to the <b>Grey</b> colour map, so the tracks' own colouring doesn't compete with a coloured density map. A toggle next to the <b>SMLM reconstruction</b> title (<b>Show tracks</b>/<b>Hide tracks</b>) switches the overlay on and off without re-plotting.</p>
<p><b>Show track data</b> opens a sortable, filterable table of the per-track summary — one row per track (<code>track_id</code>, <code>n_locs</code>, <code>D_coeff</code>, mean x/y, first/last frame), the same rows <b>Save track data</b> writes to CSV, not one row per localization (see <b>View data/filtering</b> for that). Click a column header to sort by it; type a filter (e.g. <code>n_locs &gt; 10</code>, joinable with <code>and</code>/<code>or</code>) and press Enter to apply it — cumulative, removable filter chips, same grammar as the main table. A v1 kept deliberately simple for now (no histogram-of-column, no link back to the reconstruction yet).</p>

Defaults are ported from the user's own `sptPALM-Python` pipeline's
`set_parameters_sptPALM.py` (L. lactis sptPALM), converted from that
pipeline's µm convention to webSMLM's own nm convention for spatial params
(0.8 µm → 800 nm, 0.035 µm → 35 nm) — a different setup's own step sizes and
localization precision will sit elsewhere, so treat these as a starting
point, not a universal default. `frametime` is not auto-applied from the
loaded stack — set it to match your own movie's real acquisition interval.
A TIFF/ND2 file's own embedded frame interval, when present, is logged on
load (never auto-applied — see **in/out** in `CLAUDE.md`), which can help;
but treat it as one input, not the final word — the bundled
`experimental_data/` L. lactis test file is a real example of why: its
filename implies 50 ms/frame, but its own embedded `finterval` tag says
5 ms, an unresolved 10× discrepancy. See [§2](#2-module-reference)'s **spt**
entry for the full linking/diffusion-coefficient algorithm.

### Pipeline behaviour (`pipeline`) {#pipeline-behaviour-params}

*Module:* **pipeline** — see [§2](#pipeline).

| id | Label | Type | Min | Max | Step | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `liveUpdate` | Real-time update | bool | — | — | — | true |

### Pipeline: preview / export tuning (`pipeline`) {#pipeline-tuning-params}

No page control — settings-JSON only.

*Module:* **pipeline** — see [§2](#pipeline).

| id | Label | Min | Max | Step | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rawPreviewMs` | Raw-panel live-preview interval (ms) | 16 | 2000 | 10 | 200 |

| `srPreviewMaxMs` | Reconstruction live-preview interval ceiling (ms) | 800 | 60000 | 1000 | 15000 |
| `stackProjCap` | Data-projection frame sample cap | 10 | 5000 | 10 | 300 |
| `exportMinLong` | PNG export minimum long edge (px) | 500 | 8000 | 100 | 2000 |

`rawPreviewMs` gates the raw (left) panel's live redraw during a Run —
time-based rather than a frame count, so updates land at a steady cadence
regardless of per-frame detect/fit cost. `srPreviewMs` is the *starting*
reconstruction preview interval; it adaptively grows (up to `srPreviewMaxMs`)
as each preview's own render cost grows through a long Run, so preview
overhead stays a roughly bounded fraction of wall time instead of growing
unboundedly. See the **pipeline** module / `run()`.

## 4 · Settings JSON format

Written by **Save settings**, read by **Load settings**.

```json
{
  "format": "webSMLM-settings",
  "version": 2,
  "appVersion": "0.12.5",
  "created": "2026-08-08T12:00:00.000Z",
  "values": { "pxnm": 160, "gain": 0.1248, "camoffset": 100, "winr": 4, "...": "..." }
}
```

- `values` is `{id: value}` for **every** `PARAMS` entry (not just ones with
  a page control) — the only way to set the no-page-control entries
  (`workerBatch*`, `srPreview*`, etc.) is a loaded file like this.
- `version` is the settings-file **format/schema** version (bumped only when
  the JSON's own wrapper shape changes) — a different thing from
  `appVersion` (v0.12.5-dev), the actual webSMLM release that wrote the
  file, parsed live from the running page's own version at save time.
- On load, unrecognised keys are logged (`"not recognised — ignored"`) and
  skipped rather than erroring — old files stay loadable across versions.
  One exception: a file with `sptFrameTime` (renamed to the global
  `frametime` in v0.12.1-dev — see [§1](#sidebar-pxnm-frametime)) has that
  key aliased to `frametime` before the loop runs, not silently dropped —
  a TEMPORARY back-compat step, removed once old saved files have had time
  to migrate (a fresh **Save settings** always writes `frametime`).
- **Version-mismatch advisory** (v0.12.5-dev): if the loaded file's own
  `appVersion` is NEWER than the running page's, a warning names both
  versions, lists the unrecognised key(s) that came with it, and points at
  the GitHub releases page — the usual real-world cause of an unrecognised
  key is a settings file saved by a newer webSMLM that added a setting this
  build doesn't have yet. An older file with no `appVersion` at all (saved
  before this check existed) still gets a softer "possibly saved by a newer
  version" advisory whenever it carries any unrecognised key, since there's
  no version number to be definite about. Either way this is advisory
  only — every recognised key still applies exactly as before; nothing is
  ever rejected or blocked because of a version mismatch.
- DOM-backed entries dispatch a real `change` event when set, so any
  existing listener (live preview, "Fix bead x,y" retrigger, …) reacts
  exactly as if the user had edited the control by hand.
- Today this only round-trips `{id: value}` — not `min`/`max`/`step`, which
  live solely in the hardcoded registry (see `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md` for the
  planned extension).

## 5 · Table & filter grammar

Opened by **View data/filtering**. Base row set is `getBaseLocs()` — raw
localizations, or (if a `tempClusteringXY`/`tempClusteringZ` clause is
active) merged events from `clusterEvents()`.

Building the table's rows is checked against the **Total memory budget (GB)**
setting first (`checkTableSize()`, ~200 bytes/row estimated — a small JS
object per row costs meaningfully more than its raw numeric fields once V8's
own per-object overhead is counted) — the same size-before-allocating
philosophy the **render** module's reconstruction buffers use, reusing the
same opt-in `memBudgetGB` control (default unset, so this is a no-op until
one is configured) rather than a second, separate one. If a huge
localization count would exceed a configured budget, the table doesn't open
(or, if already open, doesn't rebuild) and a log line explains why, rather
than risking a tab crash — raise the budget, or narrow the result with a filter/crop/
temporal-clustering clause first.

**Columns** (present depends on the result): `id`, `frame`, `x`, `y`, `z`
(a real 3D fit only), `dist` (sSMLM paired results only — the inter-order
distance; an INDEPENDENT column from `z`, not an alias of it — see §2
sSMLM), `sigma_xy`, `sigma_z` (MLE 3D only, an approximate z-precision —
not available for Phasor 3D), `sigma1st` (sSMLM paired results only — the
1st order's own sigma, see §2 sSMLM/§6), `intensity`, `offset`, `bkgstd`,
`uncertainty`, `nmerged` (only once clustering is active), `track_id` (once
**Track** has run — every localization gets one, see §2 spt), `D_coeff`
(µm²/s, only on localizations whose track met **SPT min track length**).

**Filter syntax:** `field op value`, chained with `and`/`or`
(e.g. `intensity > 1000 and uncertainty < 20`); `op` ∈ `> < >= <= == = !=`.
Enter commits a clause; clauses stack cumulatively (ANDed as a whole).
Typing `reset` clears all of them. An autocomplete dropdown suggests
matching field names as you type (↑/↓ to move, Enter/Tab to accept),
sourced from the current table's own columns plus the three clustering
pseudo-fields below.

Every committed clause — a typed filter, the reconstruction panel's own crop
tool (below), or a clustering pseudo-field — logs a directly-replayable
command: the log window's most recent line always reads the FULL cumulative
list as `analyze({..., tableFilters:[...]})`/`--tableFilters "..."`, so an
entire filtering session can be reproduced headlessly in one call (see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.tableFilters`).

**Clustering pseudo-fields** — `tempClusteringXY < N` (nm),
`tempClusteringZ < N` (nm), and `tempClusteringMemory <= N` (frames, or
`tempClusteringMemory <= inf` for no limit) are recognised specially
*before* the normal column grammar: rather than selecting a subset of
existing rows, they change the base row set itself, merging a blinking
molecule's own detections into higher-precision "events" (photon-weighted
position, summed photons, inverse-variance-combined uncertainty). One
value per pseudo-field — a new value replaces the old, doesn't stack.
`tempClusteringMemory` is the gap-frame tolerance: a chain may skip up to
that many frames with no detection and still be extended when the
molecule reappears (default 0 — strictly consecutive frames only, the
original behavior); it has no effect on its own — it only changes anything
once `tempClusteringXY` and/or `tempClusteringZ` is also set, since those
are what actually turn clustering on. A gap frame contributes nothing to
the position average (there's no detection there to weight in); a
long-gapped chain still matches a new candidate against its full
photon-weighted position history, unchanged from the no-gap case — apply
**Correct drift** first if using a large or unlimited memory on data with
real stage drift, since matching against a stale average gets less
reliable the longer a chain has gone unseen. `clusterEvents()` (table
module) has the full implementation notes.

**Crop tool** (SR panel, next to the line-profile tool) — click two corners
to push an x/y-range clause into the *same* `_tableFilters` array a typed
filter uses, so a crop affects reconstruction/export/NeNA/FRC identically to
any other filter. Disabled while the SR panel isn't showing a real
per-localization reconstruction (`srIsRecon`). Committing a crop also zooms/
pans the SR view to fit the cropped rectangle — the same "fit within" math
`fitZoom()` uses for the whole image, applied to the rect instead, so the
rectangle's longer axis (relative to the panel's own aspect ratio) reaches
that panel edge and the shorter one is letterboxed, rather than leaving the
crop sitting small inside the old, now mostly-empty view. Double-click/tap
the panel to return to the whole-image fit — removing the crop (deselecting
the tool, or **Reset filter**) restores the un-cropped data but leaves the
view zoomed/panned where the crop left it.

**Plot histogram of** — draws the selected column's distribution in the raw
(left) panel, over whatever rows currently pass the active filters.

## 6 · CSV export format

Written by **Save data** (`exportCSV()`), ThunderSTORM-compatible:

```
"id","frame","x [nm]","y [nm]",["z [nm]",]"sigma [nm]"[,"sigma_x [nm]","sigma_y [nm]"],"intensity [photon]","offset [photon]","bkgstd [photon]","uncertainty [nm]"[,"sigma_z [nm]"][,"dist [nm]"][,"x2 [nm]","y2 [nm]"][,"pairAngle [deg]"][,"sigma1st [nm]"][,"sx0th [nm]","sy0th [nm]","sx1st [nm]","sy1st [nm]"][,"n_merged [frames]"][,"track_id"][,"D_coeff [um^2/s]"][,"cell_id","cell_area [px]"]
```

- `z [nm]` only present for a real 3D result (a 3D fit method).
- `sigma [nm]` is kept under that literal name (not `sigma_xy`, which the
  in-app table uses) specifically for ThunderSTORM compatibility.
- `sigma_x [nm]`/`sigma_y [nm]` are present on EVERY localization (not just
  an sSMLM-paired subset) whenever the Run used an elliptical fit method
  (`mle3d`/`gaussmleEll`, see §2/fit) — the fitted per-axis width directly,
  independent of `sigma1st [nm]`/`sx0th [nm]` etc. below (those are
  sSMLM-**Pair**-specific). Round-trips through **Load data**.
- `sigma_z [nm]`, `dist [nm]`, `sigma1st [nm]`, `sx0th [nm]`/`sy0th [nm]`/
  `sx1st [nm]`/`sy1st [nm]`, `track_id`, `D_coeff [um^2/s]`, `cell_id`/
  `cell_area [px]` (each when available) and `n_merged [frames]` (when
  temporal clustering is active) are webSMLM-specific additions appended
  after the standard columns — safe for a strict ThunderSTORM reader to
  ignore.
- `cell_id`/`cell_area [px]` are present only after **Track** ran with
  **Apply segmentation** checked (see §2 spt) — `cell_id` is `-1` for a
  localization that's background or inside a cell outside **Min./Max. cell
  area**, never a real cell number for those (matching `sptPALM-Python`'s
  own `apply_cell_segmentation_sptPALM.py` sentinel convention). Round-trips
  through **Load data**.
- `dist [nm]` is sSMLM-**Pair**-specific: the inter-order distance
  (see §2 sSMLM) — an INDEPENDENT column from `z [nm]`, never a substitute
  for it; `pairCore()` never sets `z`, so a paired-only export has `dist`
  but not `z`. Round-trips through **Load data** (`parseCsvLocs()`).
- `x2 [nm]`/`y2 [nm]` (the 1st order's own raw position) and
  `pairAngle [deg]` (the pair's own directed 0th→1st bearing, same
  convention as **Primary angle**) are sSMLM-**Pair**-specific, added
  alongside `dist [nm]` — a pair's own full geometry, not just its distance
  and the 0th order's own position. `pairAngle` is deliberately a distinct
  name from the existing `angle [deg]` column above (that one is
  `gaussianMLEellipticangled`'s own per-loc ellipse rotation — a completely
  different measurement that can appear on the same paired row). Round-trips
  through **Load data** (`parseCsvLocs()`).
- `sigma1st [nm]` is sSMLM-**Pair**-specific: the 1st order's own `sigma`
  (see §2 sSMLM), carried through from `pairCore()` rather than the pair's
  reported `sigma [nm]`, which is still the 0th order's. Not a directional/
  long-axis width for most methods — every method except `mle3d`/`gaussmleEll`
  fits one symmetric `sigma`; this is the closest available proxy for how
  much wider the spectrally-smeared 1st order looks in that case. Round-trips
  through **Load data** (`parseCsvLocs()`) like `sigma_z`/`dist`/`n_merged` do.
- `sx0th [nm]`/`sy0th [nm]`/`sx1st [nm]`/`sy1st [nm]` are also sSMLM-
  **Pair**-specific, but only present when the Run used an elliptical fit
  method (`mle3d`/**Gauss MLE rotated elliptical** — `gaussmleEll`,
  renamed from "Gaussian MLE Elliptical (sSMLM)") — a real per-axis width
  for BOTH orders (not just a proxy for the 1st the way `sigma1st` is),
  since those methods fit an independent σx/σy for every localization, not
  just a symmetric `sigma`. Round-trips through **Load data** the same way.
- `track_id` and `D_coeff [um^2/s]` are spt-**Track**-specific (see §2 spt)
  — independent optional columns, present whenever any localization has
  them; `track_id` is on every tracked localization, `D_coeff` only on
  those whose track met **SPT min track length**. `um^2` (not `µm²`) is
  deliberately plain ASCII in the header, matching ThunderSTORM's own
  ASCII-only unit-bracket convention elsewhere in this format. Both
  round-trip through **Load data** (`parseCsvLocs()`).
- Exports the *currently filtered* subset (`renderLocs||lastResult.locs`),
  the same set the reconstruction shows — logged explicitly when a filter is
  active, together with the unfiltered total.
- `intensity`/`offset`/`bkgstd` are already true photon units (gain/offset
  applied inside the fit) — if gain is still 1 and offset 0 (i.e. never set),
  a warning is logged that the exported "photon" values are really raw ADU.

**Loading it back** — **Load data** (`parseCsvLocs()`) is the reverse: reads
the header to find which optional columns are present, then rebuilds a full
`lastResult` usable exactly like a completed Run's. Two things don't survive
the round trip losslessly:
- `lpx`/`lpy` (the two separate CRLB/precision components) collapse to a
  single combined `uncertainty [nm]` in the CSV; loading sets
  `lpx = lpy = uncertainty/px`, which reproduces the *same* combined value if
  re-exported, but the original x/y asymmetry (and whether it came from a
  real CRLB or the LS/phasor formula estimate) is gone.
- There's no camera frame size in a CSV, so the internal `w`/`h` (used only
  to size the reconstruction canvas) are derived from the loaded data's own
  bounding box (a +10 px margin on the high side only). Loc `x`/`y` are
  **never shifted** — `(0,0)` always means the same physical camera pixel it
  meant in the original file/session, so a re-export after loading a CSV
  back in reports exactly the same `x`/`y` values as the original. This
  matters beyond cosmetics: a segmentation image (§2 spt) loaded separately
  is expressed in that same original coordinate frame, and needs the
  localizations to stay there too for the two to overlay correctly. An
  earlier version DID re-centre the bounding box (shifting every loc so the
  low/high margins matched) purely for a tidier look on a CSV-only load with
  no raw frame to compare against — reverted once the segmentation overlay
  made that assumption wrong: the shifted coordinates no longer lined up
  with an externally-supplied segmentation image.

## 7 · Calibration JSON format

Written by **Save calib.** (`exportCalibration()`), read by **Load
calibration…** for a 3D fit method.

```json
{
  "format": "webSMLM-astig-calibration", "version": 2, "created": "...",
  "source_file": "...", "fixed_xy": false,
  "pixel_size_nm": 160, "z_step_nm": 10, "frames": { "first": 1, "last": 80 },
  "z_ref_nm": 0, "z_range_nm": { "min": -400, "max": 400 }, "n_points": 1234,
  "calibration_methods": [
    { "id": "phasor_magnitude", "label": "...", "used_by": ["phasor3d"], "model": "phasor_z_from_ratio" },
    { "id": "gaussian_width", "label": "...", "used_by": ["ls3d","mle3d"], "model": "sigma_x_nm/sigma_y_nm" }
  ],
  "sigma_x_nm": { "a": "...", "c": "...", "b": "...", "A": "...", "B": "...", "C": "..."},
  "sigma_y_nm": { "a": "...", "c": "...", "b": "...", "A": "...", "B": "...", "C": "..."},

  "phasor_z_from_ratio": { "coef": "[...]", "basis": "ratio", "rmin": "...", "rmax": "...", "rms_nm": "..."},
  "note": "..."
}
```

- Can carry **both** calibration models at once (Phasor's magnitude-ratio
  model and the Gaussian-width model MLE 3D uses) — every bead is fit both
  ways regardless of which method calibration was run for, so a single file
  covers either downstream method. `calibration_methods` is an array of
  `{id, label, used_by, model}` objects, one per model actually present.
- `sigma_x_nm`/`sigma_y_nm`/`phasor_ratio` each pack the same quadratic fit
  twice: `a`/`c`/`b` is the vertex form `σ(z) = a(z−c)² + b` (nm, `z`
  relative to the σx=σy focal crossing) that `zFromWidths()` actually
  consumes; `A`/`B`/`C` is the same curve in raw polynomial form.
- Loading infers which models are present even from an older file with no
  `calibration_methods` list (checks for the model blocks themselves), and
  warns if the currently-selected fit method needs a model the file doesn't
  contain.
- Can also be **built headlessly**, from a bead z-stack instead of clicking
  **Calibrate** — see `config.calibrationFile`/`--calibration <stack>.tif` in
  §8 below.

## 8 · Headless API (`window.webSMLM`)

The Layer 1 entry point of the scriptable/headless pipeline
(`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`). Runs the whole load → detect/fit → drift →
CSV/log/settings pipeline in one call, without touching a DOM control, a
dialog, or a Blob-download — every result comes back as in-memory data, for
a driving script (a headless-Chromium automation, Layer 2) or a future
URL-param autorun (Layer 0) to write to disk or inspect directly.

```js
const result = await window.webSMLM.analyze({
  file: fileObjectOrHandle,        // or files: [File, ...] for a multi-file sequence
  pxnm: 160, gain: 0.1248, camoffset: 100, method: 'mle3d',
  calibrationJson: parsedCalibJson,   // required for phasor3d/mle3d — see §7
  correctDrift: true, computeNeNA: true, computeFRC: true,
});
```

- `config` is **partial** — only values that differ from the `PARAMS`
  registry defaults need to appear; `defaultConfig()` (also exposed) fills
  the rest with `PARAMS[id].default`, no DOM read at all.
- `config.useGpu` is the headless form of **Use GPU acceleration
  (experimental)**. It is opt-in and per-stage adaptive; unsupported or small
  workloads fall back to CPU and report that path in `result.execution`.
- `config.file`/`config.files` — a `File` or an array of `File`s (same
  multi-file support as Ctrl/Cmd+click **Load movie**, including the
  auto-detected "several single-frame files" vs. "several chunks of one
  continuous acquisition" cases — see **in/out**), loaded via the existing
  `loadTiffFile`/`loadTiffFilesAuto`. One of the two is required.
- **`config.file` ending in `.csv`** (v0.11.13) — the headless equivalent of
  loading a CSV via **Load movie/data** (same extension-only dispatch), not
  a movie at all: parsed directly via `parseCsvLocs()`, skipping Localize
  (and so `method`/`psf`/`winr`/…), `cropX0`–`cropY1`, `estimateGainOffset`,
  and any calibration entirely — none of those apply without raw pixel data.
  Everything downstream (`sSmlmPair`, `correctDrift`, `computeNeNA`/`FRC`,
  `sptTrack`, the CSV/reconstruction/plot exports) runs exactly as it would
  on Localize's own output, since none of it ever needed a `stack`, only
  `locs`/`pxnm`. The returned `timings` is `null` (there's no Run to time).
  Multi-file CSV concatenation isn't supported (matching the interactive
  load) — always use `config.file`, never `config.files`, for a CSV.
- `config.cropX0`/`config.cropY0`/`config.cropX1`/`config.cropY1` — not
  `PARAMS` entries (per-dataset pixel geometry, same treatment as `calFirst`/
  `calLast`). If any is given, `config.file`/`config.files` is immediately
  replaced with just that native-pixel `[x0,x1)×[y0,y1)` sub-rectangle
  (`makeCroppedStack()`, [§2](#2-module-reference)'s **in/out** entry) before
  anything else — `estimateGainOffset`, `runCore` — touches it, the headless
  equivalent of the raw-panel crop tool. An omitted bound defaults to that
  edge of the full frame (`0`/`0`/width/height). Throws if the resulting
  region is under 8×8 px.
- `config.calibrationJson` — a **parsed** calibration JSON object (§7), not
  a file/string. There's no interactive session's loaded calibration to fall
  back on headlessly, so a 3D method needs this explicitly; `analyze()`
  throws immediately (mirroring `run()`'s own precondition check) if the
  selected `method` needs a model the calibration doesn't contain.
- `config.calibrationFile`/`config.calibrationFiles` — a bead z-stack
  `File`/`File`s, alternative to `calibrationJson`: builds a **fresh**
  calibration via `calibrationCore()` (the same DOM-free extraction
  `runCore` got) before the main run, instead of loading one from JSON.
  `config.calFirst`/`config.calLast` (not `PARAMS` entries — per-dataset
  state, same exception as interactively) default to the whole calibration
  stack when omitted; `calStep`/`calRef`/`calFixedXY` are ordinary `PARAMS`
  fields. Anything not explicitly given gets an `onLog` warning naming the
  default used — a silently-wrong `calStep` in particular would otherwise
  produce a badly wrong calibration with no indication anything defaulted.
  `calFixedXY` needs an interactive `locateBeadsForCalib()` session's fixed
  bead positions and so isn't supported headlessly — leave it `false`.
- `config.calibrationOnly` — build/return only the calibration, skipping the
  main analysis entirely; `config.file`/`config.files` aren't required in
  this mode. Returns `{calib, calibJsonText, logText}` only (every other
  result field is omitted).
- `config.correctDrift` / `config.computeNeNA` / `config.computeFRC` —
  booleans, not `PARAMS` entries, gating optional pipeline stages.
- `config.scoreVsTruth` — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Scores the
  localizations against the simulator's own ground truth
  (`scoreTruthCore()`, see **validation** in [§2](#validation)) and returns
  the result as `truthScore`; with `exportPlots` it also renders
  `plots.truthScore`. Only meaningful for data generated in the same
  session — a loaded file has no ground truth — so it is skipped silently
  rather than erroring. `validation_matchRadius`/`validation_zBins` are
  ordinary `PARAMS` fields and configure it.
  `config.correctDrift`'s own ESTIMATION method is the ordinary `PARAMS`
  field `driftMethod` (`'aim'`/`'correlation'`, default `'aim'`) — with
  `driftMethod:'correlation'`, the raw movie itself is needed to estimate
  the drift (image-based, not point-based), so this combination throws a
  clear error against a `.csv` input (which has no raw frame data at all —
  see `config.file`'s own paragraph below) rather than silently falling
  back to AIM.
- `config.smfretLocateSOI` (v0.12.1-dev, **experimental**) — boolean, not a
  `PARAMS` entry. The headless equivalent of clicking **Localize SOI**
  (smFRET module, see **smFRET** in `CLAUDE.md`): averages the first
  `config.smfretAvgFrames` frames (an ordinary `PARAMS` field, default 100)
  into one composite, detects real emitter positions on it once, and fits
  each — `smfretSOICore()`, the same DOM-free core the interactive button
  calls. **Mutually exclusive with the normal per-frame Localize** — set,
  it REPLACES that step entirely (same as clicking the interactive button
  replaces whatever the current result was); requires `config.file`/
  `config.files` (a real stack — unlike a `.csv` input, there's no raw pixel
  data to average without one). Every resulting site shares one `frame:0`
  (an arbitrary shared constant, not a real per-frame index) specifically so
  `config.sSmlmPreview`/`config.sSmlmPair` below can be piped straight after
  it, comparing every site against every other one — the same mechanism
  that lets a donor/acceptor SOI pair be found with sSMLM's own existing
  pairing, no new pairing code needed (`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`'s smFRET/ALEX
  sketch). `result.locs` (and therefore `result.csvText`/
  `result.reconstructionPng`) are the SOI positions; `result.timings` is
  `null` (no per-frame Run to time, same as a `.csv` input). Two optional
  extra fields (v0.12.1-dev) make the averaged composite ALEX-aware, the
  same way the interactive **Alternating-laser excitation** toggle does:
  `config.alexEnabled`/`config.alexFirstFrame` (ordinary `PARAMS` fields)
  plus `config.smfretSoiChannel` (`'donor'`/`'acceptor'`, **not** a `PARAMS`
  field — there's no interactive session to fall back on headlessly, so it
  must be passed explicitly). Omitting `smfretSoiChannel` always averages the
  WHOLE requested frame range regardless of `alexEnabled` — the original
  behaviour, so no existing headless caller's result changes.
- `config.sSmlmPreview` (v0.12.1-dev) — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. The
  headless equivalent of clicking **Preview pairs** (MODULE: sSMLM): the
  same WIDE, fixed diagnostic scan (distance 0–6000 nm, or wider still if
  `config.sSmlmDistMax` already exceeds that, at any angle) the interactive
  button runs, ignoring `config.sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmAngleCenter`/
  `sSmlmAngleTol` entirely. Not mutually exclusive with `config.sSmlmPair`
  below — request either, both, or neither; computed on the same raw
  (pre-pairing) locs `sSmlmPair` would use. `result.sSmlmPreview` records
  `{nCandidates, scanMax}` (`null` if not requested). `config.exportPlots`
  (below) additionally renders the same distance-histogram image "Save
  plot/image" would once Preview pairs has run interactively — the
  configured `sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmDistMax` drawn as markers — into
  `result.plots.sSmlmPreviewDist`.
- `config.sSmlmPair` (v0.11.1) — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Runs
  `pairCore()` (spectral SMLM pairing, see **sSMLM** in `CLAUDE.md`) right
  after Localize, before drift/NeNA/FRC — the headless equivalent of
  clicking **Pair & plot sSMLM**. `config.sSmlmDistMin`/`sSmlmDistMax`/`sSmlmAngleCenter`/
  `sSmlmAngleTol` (ordinary `PARAMS` fields) configure
  the window. `pairCore()` itself throws — propagating as a rejected
  `analyze()` promise, same "throws immediately" precedent as this API's
  other preconditions — if the localizations already have real 3D `z` (a 3D
  fit method) or already have a `dist` field (already-paired output).
  `result.sSmlmPair` records `{nPairs, nInput, meanDistance, stdDistance}`
  (`null` if `sSmlmPair` wasn't requested); on success `result.locs` (and
  therefore `result.csvText`/`result.reconstructionPng`) reflect the
  *paired* set, same as an interactive Pair replacing `lastResult.locs`.
- `config.sptTrack` (v0.11.2) — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Runs
  `sptCore()` (single particle tracking, see **spt** in `CLAUDE.md`) — the
  headless equivalent of clicking **Track**. Unlike `sSmlmPair`, runs AFTER
  `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA`/`computeFRC` rather than before: tracking
  never drops rows (`track_id`/`D_coeff` are added columns, every
  localization keeps its own row), so there's no row-count reason to run it
  early the way pairing's own row reduction motivates, but a per-track
  diffusion coefficient benefits from drift-corrected coordinates.
  `config.sptSearchRange`/`sptMemory`/`frametime`/`sptLocError`/
  `sptTrackLenMin` (ordinary `PARAMS` fields) configure it — `frametime`
  (renamed from `sptFrameTime` in v0.12.1-dev; the old key is still
  accepted, aliased with a deprecation warning, see below) is a global
  `PARAMS` entry, not spt-specific, despite `sptTrack` being its only
  current consumer. `result.spt`
  records `{nTracks, nQualify, meanD, medianD}` (`null` if `sptTrack` wasn't
  requested) — deliberately a small summary, not `sptCore()`'s own full
  `diffCoeffs`/`trackIds`/`trackLengths` arrays (`trackMSD` in particular is
  a `Map`, not JSON-serialisable — would silently become `{}` under
  `JSON.stringify()` if returned as-is); `result.locs`/`result.csvText`
  gain `track_id`/`D_coeff` columns the same way an interactive Track adds
  them to `lastResult.locs`, row count unchanged.
- `config.sptFrameTime` — **deprecated alias**, TEMPORARY. `sptFrameTime`
  was renamed to the global `frametime` in v0.12.1-dev ([§1](#sidebar-pxnm-frametime)).
  `analyze()` still accepts the old key: if `config.sptFrameTime` is set and
  `config.frametime` isn't, it's applied as `frametime` and a deprecation
  warning is logged. The same alias covers `tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs`'s
  `--sptFrameTime` (the CLI forwards raw `--key value` pairs straight into
  `config`, so no separate CLI-side change was needed) and a bookmarked
  `?autorun=1&sptFrameTime=...` URL. A saved Settings JSON with the old key
  gets the same treatment on load ([§4](#4-settings-json-format)). Remove
  once external scripts/settings have had time to migrate — new Save
  settings/Save data always write the new `frametime` key.
- `config.segmentationFile` (v0.11.6) — a `File`, not a `PARAMS` entry. Its
  mere presence switches `sptTrack` (above) from one whole-field-of-view
  tracking pass to cell-by-cell tracking, the headless equivalent of
  checking **Apply segmentation** + **Load segm. image** — a track can
  never cross a cell boundary. Loaded the same way `config.file`/
  `config.calibrationFile` are; only frame 0 is read (a segmentation mask is
  a single image). A size mismatch against the loaded movie logs a warning
  but still proceeds. `config.segAreaMin`/`segAreaMax` (ordinary `PARAMS`
  fields, default 50/no limit) gate which cells' localizations actually get
  tracked; `result.locs`/`result.csvText` gain `cell_id`/`cell_area`
  columns once this is set. Ignored if `sptTrack` itself wasn't requested.
- `config.estimateGainOffset` — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Runs
  `pcfoCore()` (PCFO gain/offset estimation, [§3/Gain-offset estimation
  (PCFO)](#pcfo-params)) on the SAME stack `config.file`/
  `config.files` just loaded, **before** the main run, then overrides
  `config.gain`/`config.camoffset` with the estimate — the headless
  equivalent of clicking **Estimate**, **Transfer estimates**, then
  **Localize**.
  `pcfoFrames`/`pcfoK`/`pcfoRnstd` are ordinary `PARAMS` fields tuning it. If
  PCFO can't fit (too few usable tiles — e.g. a very small frame), `config.gain`/
  `config.camoffset` are left as given (or their `PARAMS` defaults) and
  `result.pcfo` is `null`, same as the interactive button leaving the fields
  untouched on failure. Not available in `config.calibrationOnly` mode (no
  stack is loaded there).
- `config.exportPlots` — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Renders whichever of
  drift/NeNA/FRC/PCFO/calibration/sSMLM-preview-distance were actually
  computed this call (i.e. `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA`/`computeFRC`/
  `estimateGainOffset`/`calibrationFile`(`s`)/`sSmlmPreview` were also set)
  as BOTH a PNG and an SVG, returned in `result.plots` — one flag for
  everything available this run, not a toggle per plot. No visible browser window is needed (same headless-safe
  rendering `reconstructionPng` already uses, via a detached `<canvas>`/an
  SVG recorder — see **render** in `CLAUDE.md`). The raw frame/reconstruction
  are never included (no vector form at real localization counts, same
  reasoning as the interactive **Save plot/image** button); the line-profile
  plot is inherently interactive (a user-drawn line, no reconstruction
  geometry to draw one on headlessly) with no headless equivalent to render
  from. The calibration plot needs a FRESH build this call (`calibrationFile`/
  `calibrationFiles`) — a bare `calibrationJson` only carries the derived
  model, not the point cloud the plot needs. Works in `config.calibrationOnly`
  mode too (renders just the calibration plot, if requested).
- `config.exportHistograms` — an array of column names (e.g.
  `['photons','sigma','bg']`), not a `PARAMS` entry. Renders the shared
  column histogram (the same one **View data/filtering**'s own "Plot
  histogram of:" draws interactively) for each named column, added into
  `result.plots` as `hist_<column>` — e.g. `plots.hist_photons`. Deliberately
  independent of `config.exportPlots`: usable with or without it. Any column
  present on a localization works (`photons`/`bg`/`bgstd`/`sigma`/`x`/`y`/`z`/
  `dist`/`sigma_x`/`sigma_y`/`track_id`/`D_coeff`/etc., depending on which
  fit method and optional steps — sSMLM pairing, spt tracking — actually ran);
  a column that's absent or entirely non-finite this run logs a warning and
  is silently skipped rather than throwing. `x`/`y`/`z`/`dist`/`sigma`/
  `sigma_x`/`sigma_y` are converted to nm before histogramming, matching the
  CSV/table's own convention (they're stored in raw pixel units internally);
  every other column is histogrammed as-is.
- `config.tableFilters` — an array of filter-grammar strings (e.g.
  `['intensity > 1000', 'tempClusteringXY < 150']`), not a `PARAMS` entry.
  The headless equivalent of the **View data/filtering** table's own
  committed filters — typed clauses, the SR-panel crop tool, and
  `tempClusteringXY`/`Z`/`Memory` (see [§5](#5-table-filter-grammar) for the
  grammar) — applied in order, exactly as if each had been typed and
  committed interactively one at a time. Every interactive filter commit
  (including a crop) already logs a directly-replayable `tableFilters` array
  via `logCmd()` — copy the most recent one from the log to reproduce an
  entire filtering session headlessly, in whatever order it was built up.
  Applied LAST in the pipeline (after `sSmlmPair`/`correctDrift`/`sptTrack`),
  reshaping `result.locs` itself — so the CSV, the reconstruction PNG, and
  `exportHistograms` all see the filtered set, but `drift`/`nena`/`frc`
  above still reflect the FULL, unfiltered result (matching the typical
  interactive order: measure/correct/pair/track on everything, filter
  afterward for the final output). An unparseable clause throws, same as any
  other invalid config value.
- `config.exportTrackData`/`config.exportSSmlmCandidates`/
  `config.exportCalibrationPoints`/`config.exportPcfoTiles` — booleans, not
  `PARAMS` entries. Each streams a per-record dataset (per-track MSD curves,
  sSMLM candidate pairs, calibration bead points, PCFO tile points
  respectively) through `config.onRecord(kind, batch)` in bounded batches,
  rather than into this function's own return value — see **Streaming
  per-record exports** below for the full design and NDJSON schema, and why
  the return value specifically was the wrong place for this. Each flag
  requires the analysis step it augments to also run this call
  (`sptTrack`/`sSmlmPair`/a fresh calibration build or `calibrationOnly`/
  `estimateGainOffset` respectively) — on its own it does nothing, there
  being no dataset yet to stream records from.
- `config.exportCsvRows` — boolean, not a `PARAMS` entry. Streams
  `buildCsvText()`'s own already-chunked CSV text (§2's **export** module,
  ~5000 rows/chunk) through `config.onRecord('csv', [chunk])` instead of
  returning `csvText`/`csvParts` below — for a headless caller whose own
  return-value channel (a DevTools-Protocol JSON blob, for a Playwright-
  driven script) shouldn't carry a truly huge CSV (a real ~12-million-
  localization dataset produces a CSV well past a gigabyte). Unlike the four
  export flags above, this needs no companion analysis step — every run
  already produces `locs`, hence a CSV. `tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs` sets this
  unconditionally (not a `--exportCsvRows` CLI flag) and writes each
  streamed chunk straight to `result.csv`, verbatim (not NDJSON-wrapped —
  see **Streaming per-record exports** below).
- `config.onRecord(kind, batch)` — optional, paired with the five flags
  above. `kind` is one of `'spt_tracks'`/`'sSmlm_candidates'`/
  `'calibration_beads'`/`'pcfo_tiles'`/`'csv'`; `batch` is a plain array —
  up to 2000 plain objects for the first four (`makeRecordEmitter()`'s
  default batch size — not load-bearing, just a write/memory tradeoff), or
  a single already-formatted multi-row CSV text chunk for `'csv'` (which
  reuses `buildCsvText()`'s own chunking directly rather than re-batching
  through `makeRecordEmitter()`). Called zero or more times per export flag
  as the underlying computation produces records — never accumulated
  anywhere in-page, so a real dataset's worth of tracks/candidates/bead
  points/CSV rows (thousands to low millions) never needs to fit in one JS
  array or cross back through this function's own return value at all. A
  caller with no `onRecord` gets no records for these flags, silently — no
  error, since "didn't ask for the records" and "asked but got zero" need to
  look the same.
- `config.onProgress(pct)` — optional, called the same way `setProg()` would
  be interactively (0–100), for a driving script's own progress reporting.
- `config.onLog(msg)` — optional, called for every line `analyze()` would
  otherwise only collect into `logText` — a driving script can watch the run
  live instead of waiting for the whole thing to finish and reading
  `result.logText` after the fact. Every hook inside the pipeline
  (`loadTiffFile`/`loadTiffFilesAuto`, `runCore`, `driftCore`,
  `frcResolution`, `calibrationCore`) defaults to the real interactive
  `log()`/`setProg()` when not given one explicitly, so nothing that would
  show in the interactive Log window goes missing headlessly — `analyze()`
  just always supplies its own collector, whether or not you also supply
  `onLog`. `onLog` carries diagnostics/summaries only, not progress — a
  numeric-only percentage adds nothing once read back as text (tried, then
  reverted: it just repeated the same handful of numbers for every phase
  with no other information), so `onProgress` is the only progress channel.

**Returns** `{locs, csvText, csvParts, logText, settingsText, timings, performance, execution, reconstructionPng, drift, nena, frc, w, h, px, mag, calib, calibJsonText, pcfo, sSmlmPair, spt, plots}`:
- `performance` is a phase-timing object for the whole `analyze()` call
  (`inputMs`, `localizationMs`, `postprocessMs`, `csvMs`, `renderMs`,
  `pngEncodeMs`, `plotsMs`, etc.).
- `execution` records whether GPU was requested/available plus each measured
  stage's CPU/GPU path and fallback reason.
- `plots` is `null` unless `config.exportPlots` and/or `config.exportHistograms`
  were set; otherwise an object with only the keys for what was actually
  computed/requested this run — e.g. `{drift, nena}` if only
  `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA` were requested, plus `hist_photons` etc. for
  each column named in `exportHistograms`. Each value is `{pngDataUrl,
  svgText}`: `pngDataUrl` is a `data:image/png;base64,...` URL like
  `reconstructionPng`; `svgText` is a ready-to-write SVG document string (no
  encoding needed).
- `pcfo` is `{gain, gainStd, offset, offsetStd, r2, pts, fit}` (`pcfoCore()`'s
  return shape) when `estimateGainOffset` was requested and PCFO found
  enough usable tiles to fit, else `null`. `gain`/`offset` are what
  `config.gain`/`config.camoffset` were overridden to (so already reflected
  in `settingsText`/every downstream photon-unit conversion); `pts` is the
  full per-tile signal/noise-variance point cloud PCFO fit, for a driving
  script that wants to build its own diagnostic plot.
- `calib`/`calibJsonText` are only non-null when `calibrationFile`/
  `calibrationFiles` was given — a freshly-built calibration is worth
  writing out for reuse (`calibJsonText` is the same `*.calib.json` text
  `buildCalibJson()`/**Save calib.** produces), unlike one that was already
  loaded from an existing `calibrationJson`.
- `csvText`/`settingsText`/`logText` are ready-to-write strings — the same
  three artifacts (§4, §6) a UI session produces by hand via Save
  settings/Save data/Export log, assembled without ever touching those
  buttons. `csvText` is `null` instead of a truncated/broken string once the
  full CSV would exceed a safe per-string character count (measured
  directly against both Node's and Chrome's own V8: `2**29-24 =
  536,870,888` is the real hard ceiling — `CSV_TEXT_MAX_CHARS` in
  `webSMLM.html` stays a margin below that) — `csvParts` (below) is always
  present regardless, so a caller doesn't lose the data, only the
  single-string convenience. Also `null` (both `csvText` and `csvParts`)
  when `config.exportCsvRows` streamed the CSV via `onRecord` instead — see
  that flag above.
- `csvParts` is the same array `buildCsvText()` returns internally — ~5000-
  row string chunks, never joined into one string by this function.
  Interactive **Save data** already builds its CSV export this same way
  (`new Blob(parts, {...})`, MODULE: export) — a headless caller with a
  genuinely huge result should do the same rather than relying on `csvText`,
  which this function may leave `null` (see above) specifically for that
  case.
- `reconstructionPng` is a `data:image/png;base64,...` URL, rendered via
  `renderSuperRes()` — which already creates its own detached `<canvas>`
  internally, so this needs no page canvas element at all, headless or not.
- `nena`/`frc` are the **numeric** result objects only (`nenaPrecision()`/
  `frcResolution()`'s return shape) when requested — **no plot image yet**;
  `drawFrcPlot`/`drawNenaPlot` are still tied to the interactive `#raw`
  canvas, so a plot PNG for either is a follow-up, not implemented here.
- `drift` is `driftCore()`'s return value (`{drift, nFrames, ms}`) when
  `correctDrift` was requested — `locs` already reflects the corrected
  positions (drift correction mutates in place), so `csvText`/the
  reconstruction/NeNA/FRC all see corrected coordinates automatically, same
  as the interactive pipeline.
- `sSmlmPair` is `{nPairs, nInput, meanDistance, stdDistance}` when
  `sSmlmPair` was requested, else `null` — `locs` already reflects the
  *paired* set (fewer rows, each carrying `dist` instead of the raw pair's
  two separate rows), so `csvText`/`reconstructionPng`/any subsequent
  `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA`/`computeFRC` all see the paired result
  automatically, same as the interactive pipeline. Runs BEFORE those other
  optional stages (see **sSMLM** in `CLAUDE.md`).
- `spt` is `{nTracks, nQualify, meanD, medianD}` when `sptTrack` was
  requested, else `null` — `locs` already reflects the tracked result
  (`track_id`/`D_coeff` added, row count unchanged), so `csvText` gains
  those two columns automatically. Runs AFTER `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA`/
  `computeFRC` (see **spt** in `CLAUDE.md`), the opposite order from
  `sSmlmPair`.

`window.webSMLM.analyzeBatch(files, config)` loops `analyze()` over
multiple files with the same config (no per-file override yet). Sequential,
not parallel — `getPool()`'s worker pool is memoised process-wide, so
concurrent `analyze()` calls would contend for the same workers rather than
speeding anything up. Fails fast: one bad file rejects the whole batch.

### Live streaming (Micro-Manager camera bridge, `window.webSMLM.liveStream`) {#live-streaming}

Marked **experimental** — real and used, but younger and less battle-tested
than the rest of the app.

A different shape from `analyze()`: rather than one complete, DOM-free batch
run, `window.webSMLM.liveStream` lets an external process push frame *chunks*
in one at a time — e.g. a persistent bridge script
(`tools/webSMLM-livestream-bridge.mjs`) driving a live Micro-Manager/
pycromanager acquisition (a Gladoscopy RT node, for instance) — with each
chunk localized and the growing reconstruction rendered live in the page's
own `SMLM reconstruction` panel, exactly as an interactive **Localize** run
would. Unlike `analyze()`, this is **not** DOM-free, and there is no separate
"start" step or `config` object passed in from outside: a session arms itself
automatically the moment streaming actually begins — the sidebar's
**Connect** button for the WebSocket path, or the very first `pushChunk()`
call for this bridge path — using whatever pxnm/gain/camoffset/method/mag/
lut/etc. the page's own controls are currently set to at that moment. Once
armed:

- `window.webSMLM.liveStream.isActive()` — `true` once a session has armed
  itself (the first successful `pushChunk()` call, or **Connect**), `false`
  before that and after `end()`/**Stop**.
- `window.webSMLM.liveStream.pushChunk()` — reads whatever file the caller
  has just placed into the hidden `#liveStreamChunkInput` (e.g. via
  Playwright's `page.setInputFiles('#liveStreamChunkInput', {name, mimeType,
  buffer})`, no temp file needed), arming a new session first if none is
  active yet, localizes the file as one chunk, appends the result to the
  running total (frame numbers offset so they stay meaningful across the
  whole streamed acquisition), and repaints the reconstruction — throttled
  adaptively by elapsed time (`srPreviewMs`/`srPreviewMaxMs`,
  [§3](#pipeline-tuning-params)), the same mechanism a normal Localize
  run's own live preview uses, so a long acquisition with many small chunks
  doesn't pay a full redraw on every single one. Returns
  `{chunkFrames, chunkLocs, totalFrames, totalLocs}`.
- `window.webSMLM.liveStream.end()` — same as clicking the top-level **Stop**
  button: logs a summary and leaves the current reconstruction on screen.

Each chunk is localized independently — there is no cross-chunk context, so
temporal median filtering (FTM) is not available in streaming mode. Drift
correction, NeNA and FRC, by contrast, only ever need `lastResult.locs` and
don't care whether the session that produced it is still open — all three
become available as soon as any localizations have accumulated, and can be
re-run at any point, including while streaming is still active (Correct
drift always re-estimates from scratch across everything accumulated so
far, so re-running it mid-stream is safe; localizations that arrive
*after* a click don't retroactively pick up that correction until it's
run again). FTM genuinely isn't available in streaming mode — for that,
run a full accurate `analyze()`/**Localize** on the complete saved
acquisition afterwards (e.g. via `tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs`).

### Streaming per-record exports (NDJSON)

Some analysis steps produce a per-record dataset too detailed for a summary
number and too large/structured for a CSV row: a track's own MSD-vs-lag
curve, an sSMLM candidate pair, a calibration bead point, a PCFO tile point.
`analyze()`'s existing return value is the wrong place for these — it
crosses the DevTools Protocol as one JSON blob when driven by
`tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs`/Playwright, so a large array there doesn't just cost
in-page memory, it costs one large, slow round-trip; this is exactly why
`pcfo.pts`/`sSmlmPair.locs` are already trimmed out of the CLI's own return
handling before this feature existed (see its source comments). A real
dataset's worth of tracks, sSMLM candidates, or bead points can run from
thousands to low millions of rows, so simply adding them back — even behind
an opt-in flag — would reintroduce the exact problem the trim avoided.

The fix is to never put them in the return value at all. `config.onRecord`
is a fourth live channel (alongside `onProgress`/`onLog`), called with
`(kind, batch)` as each dataset is computed — `batch` is capped at 2000
records — so nothing here ever holds more than one batch in memory, and the
CLI never buffers a large array to hand back over CDP:

| `kind` | Requires | One record per | Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spt_tracks` | `sptTrack` | qualifying track | `track_id`, `n_locs`, `D_coeff` (`null` if under `sptTrackLenMin`), `mean_x`, `mean_y` (nm), `first_frame`, `last_frame` (1-indexed), `msd_per_lag` (`[{lag, tamsd}]`, µm² — that track's own MSD-vs-lag curve, otherwise only ever visible pooled into the interactive MSD-vs-lag plot's ensemble mean, see **spt** in `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `sSmlm_candidates` | `sSmlmPair` | candidate pair in the configured distance/angle window | `dist` (nm), `angle` (folded 0–180°), `rawAngle` (directed −180–180°) — the WIDER candidate pool `pairCore()`'s directional accept/reject pass filters down to real pairs, not the paired result itself (that's already in `csvText`'s own `dist [nm]` column) |
| `calibration_beads` | a fresh calibration build (`calibrationFile`/`Files`, or `calibrationOnly`) | detected bead per calibration frame | `fi` (0-indexed frame), `x`, `y` (px), `sx`, `sy` (elliptical-fit widths, px), `pr` (phasor magnitude ratio), `mx`, `my` (phasor magnitudes), `rrel` (fit relative residual) |
| `pcfo_tiles` | `estimateGainOffset` | image tile per sampled frame | `imsig` (mean tile signal, ADU), `noisevar` (high-frequency noise variance, ADU²) — the same points PCFO's own gain/offset regression fits |

**`csv` is a fifth `onRecord` kind, deliberately outside this table** — it
carries `buildCsvText()`'s own already-chunked CSV **text** (one complete,
newline-terminated ~5000-row string per batch, `batch=[chunk]`), not a JSON
record, and requires only `config.exportCsvRows` (every run already has
`locs` to export; no companion analysis-step flag needed the way the four
above each need one). It exists for the same reason as the other four —
`analyze()`'s return value crossing the DevTools Protocol as one JSON
blob — but at a scale the others were designed for from the start and CSV
export wasn't: a real ~12-million-localization dataset (measured directly
this session) produces CSV text past 1 GB, comfortably over both a
reasonable return-value size AND V8's own hard per-string character
ceiling (`csvText` handles the latter case on its own — see `analyze()`'s
own Returns section above — but only `exportCsvRows` avoids the return
value entirely). `tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs` sets it unconditionally (there is
no `--exportCsvRows` flag) and writes each streamed chunk straight into
`result.csv` **verbatim** — no `JSON.stringify()`, no NDJSON schema
line — since a real CSV file needs its own header row (already the first
chunk `buildCsvText()` produces), not a JSON marker line.

Each of the other four is deliberately **export-only** — none round-trips back into a load
path the way CSV/settings/calibration JSON do; there's no "load calibration
bead points" or "load PCFO tiles" feature, and none is planned. The schema
is intentionally narrow (a handful of numeric fields) rather than mirroring
every internal field these computations touch — `i`/`j` (sSMLM candidates'
own indices into that one call's transient locs snapshot, meaningless
outside it) are dropped, for instance.

`tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs` is the reference consumer: `--exportTrackData`/
`--exportSSmlmCandidates`/`--exportCalibrationPoints`/`--exportPcfoTiles`
each supply `config.onRecord` themselves, forwarding every batch live via
`console.log()` (the same real-time channel `onProgress`/`onLog` already
use — `page.on('console')` sees it well before `analyze()`'s own return
value arrives) to a Node-side listener that appends straight to a
newline-delimited JSON file (NDJSON — one compact JSON object per line, not
one big array) via `fs.createWriteStream()`: `spt_tracks.ndjson`,
`sSmlm_candidates.ndjson`, `calibration_beads.ndjson`, `pcfo_tiles.ndjson`.
The CLI sets `config.exportCsvRows` unconditionally alongside these (not a
flag the user passes) and routes the `'csv'` kind through the SAME
listener, into `result.csv` itself rather than a `.ndjson` file — the one
kind written verbatim instead of JSON-per-line, per its own entry above.
Every one of these is written alongside the usual `settings.json`/`log.txt`/
`summary.json`/etc. output. NDJSON
over a single JSON array specifically because it's writable AND readable
incrementally (a consumer — `pandas.read_json(path, lines=True)`, or a
line-by-line reader for anything larger — never needs the whole file parsed
at once) and stays valid when partial (every complete line parses on its
own; a single JSON array is invalid until its closing `]` lands, so a killed
process leaves nothing usable). Each file's first line is a schema marker
(`{"_schema":"webSMLM.<kind>.v1"}`), the same versioning precedent
`buildCalibJson()`/`buildSettingsJson()`'s own `format`/`version` fields set.
A plain in-page `analyze()` call (no CLI, e.g. from a browser console or
`?autorun=`) can supply its own `onRecord` the same way — collecting into an
array, `IndexedDB`, or its own `FileSystemWritableFileStream` — nothing here
is CLI-specific except the file-writing itself.

**Deliberately out of scope for this first pass** (`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`):
tuning the 2000-record batch size against a real large dataset; a single
combined `analysis.ndjson` with a `kind` tag per line instead of four
separate files; and dedicated interactive "Save track data (detailed
JSON)"-style UI buttons — the CLI/`analyze()` side was the priority (advanced
users doing real analysis reach for scripting over the GUI well before a
dataset gets large enough for this to matter), and the interactive path can
follow the same `onRecord`/`FileSystemWritableFileStream` mechanism later if
wanted.

### URL-param autorun (Layer 0)

`webSMLM.html?autorun=1&fileUrl=https://.../stack.tif&pxnm=160&method=mle3d&...`
runs `analyze()` automatically once the page finishes loading — no console,
no driving script, works by just opening the link in any browser.

- Every query-string key that matches a `PARAMS` id becomes that config
  field, type-coerced the same way the registry describes it (`number` →
  `+val`, `bool` → `val==='1'||val==='true'`, `enum` → the string as-is).
  Unrecognised keys are silently ignored, same tolerance as a loaded
  settings JSON.
- `correctDrift`/`computeNeNA`/`computeFRC`/`estimateGainOffset`/`sSmlmPair`/
  `sptTrack`/`exportPlots` work as `=1`/`=true` flags too, same as passing
  them to `analyze()` directly. `cropX0`/`cropY0`/`cropX1`/`cropY1` work as
  plain numeric params the same way.
- `fileUrl` (required to actually run) and `calibrationJson` come from
  **`fileUrl`/`calibrationUrl`** query params instead — both must be
  fetchable URLs, not local paths (the browser has no way to name a local
  file in a URL for security reasons; a driving script gets around this
  entirely by supplying the file via `page.setInputFiles()` and calling
  `analyze()` directly instead of using autorun). Both are fetched as a
  `Blob`/parsed JSON respectively — a `Blob` is a drop-in for `analyze()`'s
  `config.file`, since the loaders only need `.size`/`.slice()`/
  `.arrayBuffer()`, all of which `Blob` has.
- The result isn't rendered into the page — it's logged (`result.logText`)
  and stashed on `window.webSMLM.lastAutorunResult` for inspection from the
  console or read back by a driving script via `page.evaluate()`.
- `&download=1` also writes five files under **fixed filenames**, every
  run, to the Downloads folder — the same three artifacts a UI session
  produces by hand (`webSMLM_autorun_settings.json`, `_result.csv`,
  `_log.txt`) plus a timing/config summary (`_result.json`: config used +
  `nLocalizations` + `timings`) and the reconstruction
  (`_reconstruction.png`, `result.reconstructionPng` decoded to a real
  file). Written sequentially in that order, so a poller can watch for the
  PNG (written last) as a proxy for "all five are done" — `saveBlob()`'s
  `<a download>` fallback returns right after triggering the click, not
  once the browser has actually finished writing the file. This is for a
  plain script that can't reach into the page's JS heap the way
  `page.evaluate()` can, but *can* poll the filesystem — see
  `tools/browser-sweep.sh` (bash) or `tools/browser_sweep.py` (stdlib-only
  Python, arguably the easier one to read — its `webbrowser` module
  abstracts the per-OS launch command the bash version hand-rolls), both
  parameter-sweep drivers that open a real browser once per value, wait for
  these files, and collect them into a working folder. Works dialog-free in
  every browser: `saveBlob()`'s `showSaveFilePicker()` path (Chrome/Edge)
  requires a user gesture, which autorun doesn't have, so it rejects and
  falls through to a plain `<a download>` automatically.
- `?autorun=0`/`?autorun=false` (or omitting it) skips autorun entirely —
  the page behaves exactly as it always has.

### Command-line tools (`tools/`)

Three scripts drive webSMLM from outside the browser entirely — none of
them touch `webSMLM.html` itself, which stays dependency-free either way.

**`tools/webSMLM-cli.mjs`** (Layer 2) — the recommended one: a real,
**true-headless** Chromium via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), no
browser window ever opens. Uploads the input file directly
(`page.setInputFiles()` — no HTTP server, no `fetch()`, no CORS concern at
all, unlike autorun's `?fileUrl=`) and calls `analyze()` straight through
`page.evaluate()`, so the result comes back as a normal return value —  no
Downloads-folder polling, no fixed filenames, no guessing whether headless
downloads work.

```bash
cd tools
npm install                # once — also downloads Chromium for Playwright to drive
node webSMLM-cli.mjs --file /path/to/stack.tif --pxnm 160 --method gaussmle
```

Writes `result.csv`, `settings.json`, `log.txt`, `reconstruction.png` and
`summary.json` (localization count + timings + drift/NeNA/FRC/PCFO results)
to `--out` — which defaults to a `webSMLM-out` folder **next to `--file`**,
not wherever the shell happens to be, unless given explicitly. `--exportPlots`
also writes `<key>_plot.png`/`<key>_plot.svg` for each of drift/NeNA/FRC/
PCFO/calibration that was actually requested this run (see
`config.exportPlots` above) — e.g. `--correctDrift --computeNeNA
--exportPlots` writes `drift_plot.png`/`.svg` and `nena_plot.png`/`.svg`.
`--exportHistograms photons,sigma,bg` (comma-separated column names, no
spaces) writes `hist_<column>_plot.png`/`.svg` for each — independent of
`--exportPlots`, usable with or without it (see `config.exportHistograms`
above). Any
`--key=value` not listed in the script's header comment is passed straight
through as a `PARAMS` override (§3) — e.g. `--winr=6 --gain=0.1248
--camoffset=100`; `--correctDrift`/`--computeNeNA`/`--computeFRC`/
`--estimateGainOffset`/`--sSmlmPair`/`--sptTrack`/`--exportPlots`/
`--exportTrackData`/`--exportSSmlmCandidates`/`--exportCalibrationPoints`/
`--exportPcfoTiles` are bare
boolean flags — the fourth of these runs PCFO gain/offset estimation on `--file` itself before
localizing and overrides `--gain`/`--camoffset` with the estimate
(`summary.json`'s `pcfo` field records what was found:
`gain`/`gainStd`/`offset`/`offsetStd`/`r2`, `pts` trimmed since it's
redundant with the log's own summary line and can run into the thousands);
`--pcfoFrames`/`--pcfoK`/`--pcfoRnstd` (`PARAMS` overrides) tune it — see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.estimateGainOffset`.
`--sSmlmPair` pairs 0th/1st-order spectral SMLM localizations right after
Localize (`--sSmlmDistMin`/`--sSmlmDistMax`/`--sSmlmAngleCenter`/
`--sSmlmAngleTol`, ordinary `PARAMS` overrides,
configure the window; `summary.json`'s `sSmlmPair` field records
`nPairs`/`nInput`/`meanDistance`/`stdDistance`) — see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.sSmlmPair`. `--sptTrack`
links localizations into trajectories and computes a per-track diffusion
coefficient, AFTER `--correctDrift`/`--computeNeNA`/`--computeFRC` (the
opposite order from `--sSmlmPair` — a per-track D benefits from drift-
corrected coordinates) — `--sptSearchRange`/`--sptMemory`/
`--frametime`/`--sptLocError`/`--sptTrackLenMin` (ordinary `PARAMS`
overrides — `--frametime` was `--sptFrameTime` before v0.12.1-dev; the old
flag still works, aliased with a deprecation warning, see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.sptFrameTime`) configure it;
`result.csv` gains `track_id`/`D_coeff` columns,
and `summary.json`'s `spt` field records `nTracks`/`nQualify`/`meanD`/
`medianD` — see [§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.sptTrack`.
`--segmentation <mask.tif/.tiff/.nd2/.fits>` switches `--sptTrack` to cell-by-cell
tracking — a track can never cross a cell boundary. Only frame 0 is read (a
segmentation mask is a single image); a size mismatch against `--file` logs
a warning but still proceeds. `--segAreaMin`/`--segAreaMax` (ordinary
`PARAMS` overrides, default 50/no limit) gate which cells' localizations
actually get tracked; `result.csv` gains `cell_id`/`cell_area` columns.
Ignored without `--sptTrack` — see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.segmentationFile`.
`--exportTrackData`/`--exportSSmlmCandidates`/`--exportCalibrationPoints`/
`--exportPcfoTiles` each write a companion `.ndjson` file
(`spt_tracks.ndjson`/`sSmlm_candidates.ndjson`/`calibration_beads.ndjson`/
`pcfo_tiles.ndjson`) alongside the usual output — the CLI's own reference
implementation of `config.onRecord`, forwarding every batch live via
`console.log()` to a Node-side `fs.createWriteStream()` per file, so nothing
here buffers a real dataset's worth of records in memory either. Each
requires the flag it augments (`--sptTrack`/`--sSmlmPair`/a fresh
calibration build or `--calibrationOnly`/`--estimateGainOffset`
respectively) to actually have something to export from. See **Streaming
per-record exports** under [§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm) for the full
schema each file's records carry and the design rationale (why NDJSON, why
not just add these to the existing return value).
`--cropX0`/`--cropY0`/`--cropX1`/`--cropY1` (any subset — an omitted bound
defaults to that edge of the full frame) replace `--file` with just that
native-pixel sub-rectangle before anything else touches it, the headless
equivalent of the raw-panel crop tool — see
[§8](#8-headless-api-window-websmlm)'s `config.cropX0` for the full behaviour.
`--headed` opens a real (non-headless) window — note that the
window itself stays visually idle throughout, since `analyze()` never
touches the DOM while running, by design (that's what makes it safe to run
headless in the first place). Progress and log lines instead stream to the
**terminal** live as the run progresses, via `page.on('console')` —
real-time, unlike `page.evaluate()`'s return value, which only arrives once
the whole run is done — so `--headed` is really only useful for confirming
the page loaded without error or for manually opening DevTools mid-run, not
for watching progress. Two channels, both forwarded live: an in-place
(`\r`-overwriting, terminal-width-truncated) progress bar driven by every
`onProgress` call, with the most recent `onLog` line shown next to it as a
"currently running" status; every `onLog` line (file-load diagnostics, the
`Run:`/timing summary, warnings) is also printed on its own line as it
arrives and lands verbatim in `log.txt`, so the terminal view and the saved
log always match — `onLog` carries no percentage text, `onProgress`/the bar
is the only place progress shows.

`--calibration <path>` **overloads on file extension**: a `.json` supplies
`config.calibrationJson` (used as-is), a `.tif`/`.tiff` supplies
`config.calibrationFile` — a bead z-stack `analyze()` builds a **fresh**
calibration from before the main run (via `calibrationCore()`), then also
writes it out as `<name>_calib.json` alongside the usual output, so it can
be reused without rebuilding:

```bash
node webSMLM-cli.mjs --file stack.tif --method mle3d --calibration calib.json --pxnm 160 --gain 0.1248 --camoffset 100
node webSMLM-cli.mjs --file stack.tif --method mle3d --calibration beadstack.tif --calStep 10 --pxnm 160
```

`--calFirst`/`--calLast`/`--calStep`/`--calRef` set the calibration
range/step/z=0 reference (same meaning as the interactive Calibrate
controls); anything not given defaults (whole stack / `PARAMS.calStep`
=10 nm / `PARAMS.calRef`=auto) with a warning printed/logged, since a
silently-wrong `--calStep` in particular would otherwise produce a badly
wrong calibration with no indication anything defaulted. `--calibrationOnly`
builds/writes just the calibration and skips localizing entirely — `--file`
isn't required in that mode:

```bash
node webSMLM-cli.mjs --calibration beadstack.tif --calibrationOnly --calStep 10 --pxnm 160 --out ./calib-out
```

**`tools/browser_sweep.py`** (stdlib-only Python) and **`tools/browser-sweep.sh`**
(bash, with OS detection for macOS/Linux/Windows) — simpler alternatives
that need no `npm install`, but drive a real *visible* browser (no true
headless mode) through a sweep of one parameter's values (e.g. fit radius),
via `?autorun=1&download=1&...` + polling the Downloads folder for the
files it writes (see above). Good for "try several settings and compare
timings" without installing anything; reach for the CLI instead for a
single run, true headless operation, or CI.
