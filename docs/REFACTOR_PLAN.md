# webSMLM — Roadmap

Forward-looking notes only: things worth remembering and testing later, not a
history. Shipped features — and the implementation detail behind them — live
in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); this file doesn't duplicate it.

## Next

- **Ground-truth scoring findings** (v0.12.0-dev, build 2026-09-04e) — measured once **Score vs
  truth** (MODULE: validation) made them measurable, and worth acting on:
  - The default **Filaments + ring** test object overstates lateral error by roughly 50%, and not
    through defocus: at the *same* depth band its lateral RMSE is 22.7 nm against 14.6 nm for a
    uniform 3D volume at identical emitter density. The cause is self-crowding — emitters lie along
    1-D curves, so 15.3% of them sit within 500 nm of another simultaneously-active emitter versus
    ~7% for the scattered structures, and overlapping PSFs go through a single-emitter fitter.
    Accuracy figures quoted from the default object are pessimistic; prefer **Uniform 3D volume**
    (statistics) or **Tilted plane** (diagnostics). Worth revisiting whether the default should
    change, which would alter every existing comparison.
  - **Sub-plane z placement**: blending two PSF *intensities* is not interpolating the PSF's
    *width*, and a mixture of two differently-wide PSFs is broader than the one halfway between
    them. Measured: at a 25 nm kernel z step blending and nearest-plane are indistinguishable
    (axial RMSE 82.4 vs 80.4 nm, uncertainty ~2.7 nm); at 100 nm blending is worse (84.7 vs
    81.8 nm). Currently handled by warning above a 50 nm step. A width-aware interpolation (or a
    spline through the z-stack, which the cubic-spline PSF item below would bring anyway) would
    remove the trade-off rather than manage it.
  - Not yet done: cross-validating **Phasor 3D against Gaussian MLE 3D** on the same scored
    dataset. The tooling for it now exists — run both over one simulated stack and compare the
    axial bias/RMS-versus-depth curves.


- **Cubic-spline PSF fitting** (`picasso/fitting/splinefit.py`) for PSFs that deviate from
  Gaussian — meaningfully bigger scope than the rotated-elliptical MLE fitter (shipped): its own
  3D calibration volume and PSF-model representation, not just another free parameter. Key
  references: Babcock & Zhuang, "Analyzing Single Molecule Localization Microscopy Data Using
  Cubic Splines," *Sci. Rep.* 7, 552 (2017); Li et al., "Real-time 3D single-molecule localization
  using experimental point spread functions," *Nat. Methods* 15, 367–369 (2018).

- **File-size/modularity strategy for `webSMLM.html`.** Splitting the *core* app across multiple
  files was ruled out — `file://` blocks `fetch()`/dynamic `import()` under CORS in Chromium,
  inconsistently across browsers, breaking the "download and it just works" promise. Current
  approach: lean on the `MODULE:` banner convention plus the top-of-file **MODULE INDEX**
  line-number comment. Still on the table if the file keeps growing:
  - **Dev-time-only source split, single-file at ship time** — a `tools/`-tier build script
    concatenates `src/*.js` fragments into the final `webSMLM.html`, solving editability without
    touching the deployed artifact or the `file://` promise. Not implemented; revisit once the
    MODULE-banner approach alone stops being enough.
  - **Split SPT/smFRET out as their own single-file sibling apps** (`webSPT.html`, `webFRET.html`)
    — considered and set aside: they'd share too much of webSMLM's own pipeline (TIFF loading,
    worker pool, table/render/export) to cleanly separate, and some real analyses combine SPT and
    smFRET directly (Fontana, Fijen, Lemay, Mathwig & Hohlbein, *Lab Chip* (2018),
    [10.1039/C8LC01175C](https://doi.org/10.1039/C8LC01175C)). Revisit only if a future module
    needs almost nothing from the shared pipeline.

- **Nikon ND2 loading** — deliberate scope limits, not oversights:
  - **Multi-channel and non-16-bit** files throw a clear unsupported-format error rather than
    attempting to misread them.
  - **Multi-file ND2 concatenation** — TIFF's own `loadTiffFilesAuto()` can combine several
    single-frame files into one stack; ND2 can't yet.
  - The trailing `ND2 FILEMAP SIGNATURE NAME 0001!` index chunk isn't used as a shortcut —
    `readNd2ChunkHeader()` still walks the whole chunk chain linearly. Fine at the sizes tested
    (indexing cost scales with frame count, not file size beyond that), but a genuinely huge ND2
    file could benefit from reading this index instead.

- **FTM (fast temporal median filter)** — remaining gaps:
  - Scrub-preview speed at large frame sizes (measured, 8 workers: ~23 ms at 128×128 up to ~510 ms
    at 1024×1024 per scrubbed frame — fine smaller, laggy for rapid dragging on large ones). A
    finer row-band split, or reusing detect/fit's frame-batch workers differently, are options.
  - The worker-parallel Localize path only reports progress at chunk boundaries (no intra-chunk
    granularity, unlike the serial path) — would need a new worker message type (periodic progress
    pings ahead of the final result); not attempted since the barrier structure (see CLAUDE.md's
    Web Worker gotcha) already makes that a bit delicate.
  - `fitFirstFrame`/`fitLastFrame` (the analysis frame range) stays a *separate* range from FTM's
    own independent Start/End (which frames the filter itself runs over) — no UI for the latter yet.
  - A real (not synthetic) per-candidate MLE fit-time regression was reported on GATTA-PAINT data
    with FTM on (~160→270 µs/candidate) that a synthetic A/B test couldn't reproduce — likely the
    Newton solver needing more iterations on real corrected-background statistics, not yet
    confirmed against real data.

- **Spectrally resolved SMLM (sSMLM)** — remaining, not yet implemented:
  - **Multi-order chaining** (0-1-2-3+, matching `sSMLMAnalyzer`'s `sSMLMA.java` full feature set)
    — true higher orders (2nd, 3rd) are a distinct question from the ±1st-order symmetry already
    confirmed; nothing examined so far demonstrates a genuine 2nd-order signal at a *different*
    distance from the 1st-order band, so this still needs its own dataset/validation, not just the
    algorithm.
  - **FFT-based automatic angle/distance detection**, matching `sSMLMAnalyzer`'s
    `AngleAnalyzer.java` (render localizations to an image, 2D-FFT it, find the dominant periodic
    peak — not a drop-in for webSMLM's own inline FFT, a 1D radix-2 transform for FRC). **Preview
    pairs**' distance/angle histograms cover the same "find my window" need more simply for now.
  - A minimum-neighbour-count spatial consistency filter (reject sparse false pairs with too few
    nearby confirmed pairs) — `sSMLMAnalyzer` has one, webSMLM doesn't.

- **smFRET/ALEX integration** — a genuinely new analysis MODALITY, not a small addition; sketched
  here per discussion, not scoped in detail yet. References: Kapanidis, Lee, Laurence, Doose,

  alternating-laser excitation of single molecules," *PNAS* **101**(24), 8936–8941 (2004),

  **The measurement**: molecules immobilised on a surface, imaged in two spectrally separated
  detection channels — donor channel (DD, donor excitation → donor emission) and acceptor channel
  (DA, donor excitation → acceptor emission via FRET). With ALEX, donor-excitation frames alternate
  with acceptor-excitation frames, adding AA (acceptor excitation → acceptor emission, probing
  acceptor existence directly) and AD (acceptor excitation → donor channel, ideally ~0). Per-frame
  intensities at a molecule's fixed position give E_raw = DA/(DA+DD) and, with ALEX, S_raw =
  (DD+DA)/(DD+DA+AA) — a stoichiometry that separates donor-only/acceptor-only/both-present
  populations on a 2D E–S histogram. **Accurate FRET** (correcting E_raw/S_raw for leakage/
  crosstalk, direct excitation, and the γ-factor derived from that same population structure) is
  explicitly a later step, not v1.

  **Mapped onto webSMLM's own building blocks** — surprisingly little is genuinely new:
  - **sSMLM's grating-dispersed 0th/1st order IS already a virtual donor/acceptor channel setup —
    not just the pairing math below.** A diffraction grating spectrally splits each emitter's own
    emission into an 0th-order (undispersed) and 1st-order (dispersed) spot on ONE frame; with the
    right grating/filter choice, that split can separate donor vs. acceptor emission directly — the
    same physical trick an image splitter does spatially, just done spectrally instead. For THIS
    acquisition mode specifically, no new dual-channel loading infrastructure is needed at all (see
    "Genuinely new infrastructure" below, which is scoped to the image-splitter/two-camera cases
    only) — one movie, the existing detect/fit pipeline, `pairCore()`'s existing pairing, all
    already built and tested. Likely the cheapest real path to a working v1 prototype, ahead of the
    harder image-splitter/two-camera cases that need genuinely new loading code first.
  - **"Determine positions of interest" = the existing "Fix bead x,y" pattern.** Averaging a
    user-selected frame range into one stable composite, detecting once, and fitting each detected
    maximum is already implemented (`averageFrames()`/`locateBeadsForCalib()`, 3D calibration
    module) for exactly the same reason it's needed here: real blinking/bleaching between frames
    makes per-frame detection jump around, so localise once from a stable average instead. The only
    new piece is letting the user pick WHICH frames feed that average — DD, DA, or DD+DA (and, if
    ALEX is on, scoping to donor-excitation frames only, vs. also including AA/acceptor-excitation
    frames) — rather than always the whole loaded range.
  - **Linking a DD candidate to its DA partner = sSMLM's own pairing.** `pairCore()`'s directional
    distance+bearing-angle matching (built for 0th/1st-order diffraction-grating pairs) assumes a
    roughly CONSTANT offset vector between two related spots — exactly what a well-aligned dual-view
    image splitter gives between donor and acceptor sub-images (translation-dominated, unlike a
    diffraction grating's dispersion, but the same "search a fixed distance/angle window" math).
    Reusing it sidesteps needing a full affine channel-registration transform for a first pass —
    IF channel misalignment really is translation-dominated on real data. Working assumption (per
    discussion): translation (distance + angle, sSMLM's own pairing as-is) is likely sufficient for
    the hardware in question — but this is a guess, not a measurement, and needs checking against
    real dual-channel raw data before committing to it; a splitter/setup with meaningful rotation or
    magnification mismatch between channels would need a proper affine map instead (fit from a
    bead/fiducial image visible in both channels).
  - **Building the DD(t)/DA(t)/(AA(t)) trace = the calibration module's own "fit at fixed x,y."**
    Once a molecule's position is fixed (composite + link step above), the 3D calibration module
    already fits amplitude/σx/σy/background PER FRAME at a fixed x,y without re-detecting — the same
    operation needed here, just reading out amplitude/photons over time instead of width over a
    z-scan. **Run smFRET** would do this for every linked position across every frame (bucketed into
    DD/DA/AA by ALEX frame role), building one row per molecule per frame.
  - **Output = the existing streaming-NDJSON precedent**, not a new mechanism — `spt_tracks.ndjson`
    (`makeRecordEmitter()`, this session) is the same shape of problem (many molecules × many
    frames, too large for `analyze()`'s own return value), so a `smfret_traces.ndjson` stream (one
    record per molecule with its own DD/DA/AA-vs-frame arrays, or one record per molecule-frame —
    TBD) is a natural reuse rather than a new export mechanism. E_raw/S_raw are then trivial derived
    columns from DD/DA/AA, no new algorithm.
  - Molecules that aren't perfectly immobilised (tethered particle motion) could reuse **spt**'s own
    `linkTracks()` instead of a fixed-xy assumption — a distinct, later option, not needed for a
    genuinely immobilised-molecule v1.

  **Genuinely new infrastructure, not a reuse of anything existing** — none of this applies to the
  sSMLM-style acquisition mode above, only to the alternative hardware setups:
  - **Dual-channel input for an image-splitter or two-camera setup.** Today one frame = one
    full-FOV image with one meaning. A single-camera image-splitter setup needs a frame-region
    split (two sub-rectangles of the SAME frame, donor + acceptor) — structurally like the
    raw-panel crop tool's `makeCroppedStack()`, but producing TWO frame-synchronised sub-stacks
    from one crop step instead of one. A two-camera setup (separate donor/acceptor cameras) needs
    genuinely new frame-synchronised dual-stack loading — no existing precedent to lean on there.
  - **ALEX frame-role bookkeeping.** Which frames are donor-excitation vs. acceptor-excitation is
    new state nothing in webSMLM tracks today (a period/pattern control, or explicit frame-index
    lists) — needed before any DD/DA/AA/AD sorting can happen.

  Not scoped: whether this becomes its own sidebar module (most likely, given the size — a new
  "smFRET (ALEX)" section, not squeezed into sSMLM or 3D calibration) vs. a mode of an existing one;
  headless/CLI support (should follow the same `analyze()`/PARAMS pattern as everything else, once
  the interactive shape is settled); and the accurate-FRET correction-factor step, deliberately
  deferred per the references above.

- **Single particle tracking (spt)** — deliberately deferred, not forgotten:
  - **Length-resolved D histogram** (the reference pipeline's `D_track_length_matrix`, one
    histogram per track length rather than one pooled/ensemble one — distinct from the ensemble
    MSD-vs-lag plot already shipped) and **colour-reconstruction-by-D** (the render module's
    `colorField` mechanism sSMLM's `dist` already uses could extend to `D_coeff`, but D is
    track-level, not per-loc like z/dist, so this needs its own design, not a drop-in — distinct
    from the already-shipped tracks-overlay colour-by-D, which colours the polylines, not the
    density reconstruction itself).
  - **Real `10^x`-formatted tick labels** for the D histogram's log10(D) x-axis — still literal
    log10 numbers (a deliberate v1 shortcut reusing `computeHist()`/`drawHistogram()` unchanged)
    rather than a genuinely log-scale-aware axis.
  - **Large-subnetwork exact assignment.** `linkTracks()`'s connected components above
    `HUNGARIAN_MAX` (120 points) fall back to greedy nearest-neighbor rather than trackpy's own
    recursive exact-subnetwork solver — real single-molecule (PALM-style, sparse) SPT data isn't
    expected to produce components that large; no reports of it mattering yet.

- **`tempClusteringMemory`** — gap-frame tolerance for temporal clustering. `clusterEvents()`
  (table module) currently requires strictly consecutive frame numbers to chain detections into
  one event (memory=0, hardcoded) — a molecule that blinks off for even one frame starts a new
  chain instead of extending the old one. `tempClusteringMemory = N` would allow up to N missed
  frames between detections of the same chain. Needs a decision on how a gap should weight into the
  position average (still "on" for the photon-weighted mean, or purely bridge the chain without
  contributing) before implementing. Already flagged in-app as "planned" (see `webSMLM.html` near
  `clusterEvents()`).

- **Let a settings JSON override a parameter's `min`/`max`/`step`, not just its value.** Today
  Save/Load Settings only round-trips `{id: value}` pairs — the bounds themselves live solely in
  the hardcoded `PARAMS` registry and can't be changed without editing the file. Letting a loaded
  JSON optionally carry `{id: {value, min, max, step}}` and apply the bounds to both the in-memory
  `PARAMS[id]` entry and the DOM control (reusing `syncParamControls()`'s write path) would let
  someone with unusual data (e.g. a camera gain far outside today's 0.001–1000 range) relax a
  boundary without touching the source. Needs a decision on whether `saveSetBtn` should emit bounds
  by default (a fully self-describing saved file) or only on request (keeping normal saves small).

- **Let Load Settings introduce whole new modules, not just parameter values.** Today a loaded JSON
  can only set values for parameters the registry already knows about. A further step would let a
  loaded file *extend* the registry itself — e.g. ship a new detection filter or fit method's
  parameters (and, harder, its code) bundled with a settings file. Needs real design (where does
  the new module's *code* come from in a single-file, no-build app? a `Function`-constructed
  snippet in the JSON? a second file?) — flagged as a direction, not scoped yet.

- **Regression test suite via `analyze()`**: fixed-seed synthetic stack → assert localization count
  and RMS error within bounds. Nothing automated exists yet (no test files, no CI). A building
  block already exists for the drift half: the synthetic generator emits `simTrueDrift`, a known
  ground-truth drift curve already used to print an interactive RMS score after **Correct drift**
  — but nothing asserts against it automatically, and there's no equivalent known-Z ground truth
  yet for 3D work. Falls out of the v0.10.0 headless pipeline API (`docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` §8) once
  someone picks this up.
- Cross-validate **MLE 3D vs Phasor 3D** on real bead data — only checked against synthetic ground
  truth and mutual self-consistency so far.
- **3D detection beyond astigmatism** — Double Helix, Biplane, etc. could be added later as
  additional methods in the `3D calibration` module, alongside today's astigmatic σ_x/σ_y-vs-z
  approach.
- Cross-validate **NeNA and FRC** against established tools (ThunderSTORM, Picasso, FRCbar) — both
  still ship marked experimental.
- **3D FSC** (Fourier Shell Correlation) — the spherical-shell counterpart to 2D FRC, once the 3D
  voxel-grid memory cost is bounded.
- **Multi-emitter fitting** for dense/overlapping PSFs. Single-emitter fitting biases positions
  where PSFs overlap, and a faster single-emitter fit can't fix that — a better initial guess
  doesn't help when there's no good single-emitter optimum to find in the first place (see the
  rejected phasor-seeding idea in the v0.3.0 changelog entry, which ran into exactly this).
- **Robust detection threshold.** `mean + k·σ_noise` is computed over the whole filtered frame
  including signal, so at high blink density the threshold rises and dim localizations get
  silently dropped — detection sensitivity is density-dependent. Consider MAD or a low percentile
  of the filtered image instead. Also: threshold statistics currently include border pixels never
  searched for maxima; and plateau handling needs a look — the local-maximum test uses strict `>`,
  so two equal adjacent pixels can both survive as separate localizations from one emitter.
- **σ_PSF estimation from the data**, instead of a fixed, user-supplied value.
- **Photon calibration beyond a single scalar gain/offset.** Single-image gain/offset estimation
  from the data itself (PCFO, a photon-transfer-curve variant) shipped in 0.10.2. A scalar still
  reasonably approximates an EMCCD chip, but most current SMLM runs on sCMOS, where gain, offset
  and read noise are all pixel-dependent — still open: **per-pixel** calibration maps, with a noise
  model that uses them.

  **Complexity comparison, Huang/Picasso vs. ACCéNT** — both reduce to the SAME two-step shape: (1)
  per-pixel offset + read-noise from dark data alone, a simple temporal mean/variance pass,
  architecturally identical to FTM's own per-pixel temporal computation (already proven at scale
  here); (2) per-pixel GAIN from a per-pixel linear regression of variance vs. mean across several
  DIFFERENT signal levels — the same `polyfit`-grade math either way, so the math isn't the
  differentiator:
  - **Picasso/Huang** varies signal level via CONTROLLED ILLUMINATION (a bright reference series,
    several movies at different brightness). Simple math, but needs a dimmable/controllable light
    source most setups aren't automated for — and since webSMLM has no camera control, the user
    has to capture that series externally and just load the resulting movie(s); real UI/
    data-management overhead (matching several movies to their own intensity "level") on top of the
    easy dark-only step.
  - **ACCéNT** varies signal level via EXPOSURE TIME instead, exploiting that dark current is
    itself Poisson and scales with exposure time — no light source needed, a genuine ergonomic win.
    But the published protocol uses 5–10 exposure times × up to a few thousand frames each
    (~8,000–20,000 frames total, per Diekmann et al.) — MORE total acquisition than Picasso's own
    single 1,000-frame dark series — and needs precise per-block EXPOSURE-TIME bookkeeping
    webSMLM's TIFF loader doesn't track today (`tiffScaleHint()` reads `finterval=`/pixel size from
    ImageJ-style description text, not a literal "exposure time for this movie" tag): likely the
    same "several separate movie files, matched up by hand" burden as Picasso's bright series, just
    on a different axis. Also genuinely unverified from the literature summary alone (re-check the
    primary source before committing): whether ACCéNT's own per-pixel GAIN output is meaningfully
    higher-resolution than a coarse/near-global estimate in practice — dark current's usable
    dynamic range is small next to real photon flux, so it may not clearly beat Picasso's
    bright-series gain map on FIDELITY, only on acquisition ergonomics.
  - **Neither is obviously the smaller port** — both need new multi-movie/multi-condition data
    plumbing for the gain step specifically; the dark-only offset/noise step is the easy part
    either way, common to both.

  **No shortcut for the GAIN map — a real correction, not just an open question.** An earlier draft
  of this note proposed reusing PCFO's own tile-pooling trick per-tile-position instead of globally,
  as a cheap per-pixel gain estimate. That doesn't work, and the reason is structural: a per-pixel
  gain needs REPEATED measurements of ONE SPECIFIC PIXEL at several genuinely different, deliberately
  varied signal levels, so a slope can be fit for that pixel alone. PCFO's global fit instead gets
  its dynamic range by pooling DIFFERENT PIXELS' single-frame brightness together — valid only for
  estimating a gain SHARED across the whole pool. Borrowing brightness variation from a neighbouring
  tile to estimate "the gain at this one location" bakes in the assumption that gain is locally
  uniform, which is circular — it can't detect the very pixel-to-pixel differences it's meant to
  measure. A single tile's own frame-to-frame fluctuation isn't a substitute either: ordinary SMLM
  background stays roughly constant between frames at any one location, so there's rarely genuine
  signal-LEVEL variation to regress against there in the first place. **Per-pixel offset and
  read-noise variance ARE genuinely free from one ordinary dark movie** (temporal mean/variance per
  pixel, single condition, no varied illumination or exposure needed — same shape as FTM's existing
  per-pixel temporal pass). **Gain is not** — it structurally needs the same multi-condition
  acquisition Picasso/Huang or ACCéNT use (an illumination series or an exposure-time ladder),
  applied globally so every pixel is measured at the SAME set of true signal levels. There's no
  cheaper substitute; v1 should implement one of those two protocols properly, not look for a
  shortcut around the underlying statistics.

  **A cheaper first step than implementing any of the above: just LOAD maps computed elsewhere.**
  ImageJ/Fiji (via ACCéNT's own plugin) or Picasso itself can already produce offset/gain/variance
  maps — webSMLM doesn't have to own the acquisition-and-regression pipeline to benefit from
  per-pixel calibration, only the "load a map, feed it into `mleNewtonFit()`'s existing `var` hook"
  half. This is a MUCH smaller, self-contained v1 (a file loader + the small MLE accumulator change
  from Huang's note above, no new acquisition UI, no multi-condition file plumbing at all) —
  probably worth doing before, or instead of, building any in-app calibration workflow. Likely a
  niche feature either way (most users won't have or want to run a separate calibration pipeline),
  so low urgency, but a good candidate for "small effort, real capability" if anyone asks for
  sCMOS-aware fitting before the bigger acquisition workflow is worth building.

  **Proposed integration** (per discussion, for whichever route actually gets built): stays inside
  the existing **Gain & offset estimation** module (`pcfoBox`), not a new sidebar section — a
  camera-model select, **EMCCD** (today's scalar path, unchanged, stays the default) vs. **sCMOS**
  (per-pixel), reveals sCMOS-specific inputs: at minimum a "Load calibration map" file picker (the
  cheap route above); if the in-app acquisition workflow is ever built too, also a dark-movie loader
  (offset + read-noise variance, one file) and, for gain, a loader for SEVERAL movies at different
  known-varying conditions (a bright series or an exposure-time ladder) — genuinely new file/
  condition-management UI, not a reuse of whatever single stack happens to already be loaded. The
  two existing buttons keep doing their own jobs, not new ones: **Estimate** runs either the current
  pooled-global regression (EMCCD) or the new per-pixel regression across the loaded calibration
  movie(s) (sCMOS); **Transfer estimates** either writes the scalar `gain`/`camoffset` fields as it
  does today, or — sCMOS path — stashes the computed maps into new module-level state the fit
  pipeline reads instead of a scalar.

    (https://picassosr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/localize.html#scmos-camera-calibration): dark movie
    (1000+ frames) → offset + read-noise-variance maps; optional bright reference series at several
    illumination levels → gain map. Loaded maps override the scalar `gain`/`camoffset` fields (set
    to the maps' own medians, then disabled) — matches the "Transfer estimates" idea above closely.

    original model, and the reason applying a map is a smaller lift than it looks regardless of how
    it's obtained: read-noise variance enters the Poisson likelihood as an ADDITIVE
    equivalent-photon term on both data and model (`data+var/gain²` vs `model+var/gain²`), not a
    separate noise term. The MLE fitters' shared `mleNewtonFit()` accumulator is already
    per-pixel-`var`-aware (Picasso's own `_estimator_terms(mle, value, data, var)`, see **fit** in
    `CLAUDE.md`) — swapping today's scalar `var` for a per-pixel lookup needs no new solver.
    Phasor/LS have no equivalent hook, so a first pass should scope this to MLE methods only.

  Genuinely unscoped beyond the above: storage format for a computed/loaded map (a JSON sidecar of
  flat `Float32Array`s, like the existing 3D calibration JSON, is the likely choice — ADU² variance
  and a gain ratio don't fit comfortably in a 16-bit-integer TIFF the way a segmentation label mask
  does, though a float-sample TIFF isn't ruled out, not checked against the UTIF-based reader); how
  a map's pixel indices track a cropped/streamed stack (likely needs the same offset bookkeeping
  `makeCroppedStack()` already does for the movie itself); whether Load/Save Settings should
  round-trip a map at all (probably its own file, too large for the flat settings JSON); and whether
  DETECTION should also become noise-map-aware — a separate, likely harder problem tangled up with
  "Robust detection threshold" above, not assumed solved here.
- Optional **fiducial-based drift correction** when beads are present (simpler and more accurate
  than AIM for that specific case).
- **3D point-cloud view** — an interactive, rotatable scatter (orthographic projection, colour = z)
  as an alternative to the depth-coded 2D reconstruction, where localizations at different z that
  overlap in x/y currently blend together.
